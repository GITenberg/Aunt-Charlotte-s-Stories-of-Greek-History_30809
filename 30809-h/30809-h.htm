<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>
<img class='dc' alt='I' title='I' src='images/dc3.jpg' />n this
little book the attempt has been to trace Greek History so as to
be intelligible to young children.&nbsp; In fact, it will
generally be found that classical history is remembered at an
earlier age than modern history, probably because the events are
simple, and there was something childlike in the nature of all
the ancient Greeks.&nbsp; I would begin a child&rsquo;s reading
with the History of England, as that which requires to be known
best; but from this I should think it better to pass to the
History of Greece, and that of Rome (which is in course of
preparation), both because of their giving some idea of the
course of time, and bringing <!-- page 4--><a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>Scripture
history into connection with that of the world, and because
little boys ought not to begin their classical studies without
some idea of their bearing.&nbsp; I have begun with a few of the
Greek myths, which are absolutely necessary to the understanding
of both the history and of art.&nbsp; As to the names, the
ordinary reading of them has been most frequently adopted, and
the common Latin titles of the gods and goddesses have been used,
because these, by long use, have really come to be their English
names, and English literature at least will be better understood
by calling the king of Olympus Jupiter, than by becoming familiar
with him first as Zeus.</p>

<img class='dc' alt='I' title='I' src='images/dc11.jpg' /> am
going to tell you the history of the most wonderful people who
ever lived.&nbsp; But I have to begin with a good deal that is
not true; for the people who descended from Japhet&rsquo;s son
Javan, and lived in the beautiful islands and peninsulas called
Greece, were not trained in the knowledge of God <!-- page
12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>like
the Israelites, but had to guess for themselves.&nbsp; They made
strange stories, partly from the old beliefs they brought from
the east, partly from their ways of speaking of the powers of
nature&mdash;sky, sun, moon, stars, and clouds&mdash;as if they
were real beings, and so again of good or bad qualities as beings
also, and partly from old stories about their forefathers.&nbsp;
These stories got mixed up with their belief, and came to be part
of their religion and history; and they wrote beautiful poems
about them, and made such lovely statues in their honour, that
nobody can understand anything about art or learning who has not
learnt these stories.&nbsp; I must begin with trying to tell you
a few of them.</p>
<p>
<a href="images/p14.jpg">
<img class="floatleft" alt=

title=
"Head of Jupiter"
src="images/p14.jpg" />
</a>In the first place, the Greeks thought there were twelve
greater gods and goddesses who lived in Olympus.&nbsp; There is
really a mountain called Olympus, and those who lived far from it
thought it went up into the sky, and that the gods really dwelt
on the top of it.&nbsp; Those who lived near, and knew they did
not, thought they lived in the sky.&nbsp; But the chief of all,
the father of gods and men, was the sky-god&mdash;Zeus, as the
Greeks called him, or Jupiter, as he was called in Latin.&nbsp;
However, as all things are born of Time, so the sky or Jupiter
was said to have a father, Time, whose Greek name was
Kronos.&nbsp; His other name was Saturn; and as Time devours his
offspring, so Saturn was said to have had the bad habit of eating
up his children as fast as they were born, till at last his wife
Rhea contrived to give him a stone in swaddling clothes, and
while he was <!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>biting this hard morsel, Jupiter was
saved from him, and afterwards two other sons, Neptune (Poseidon)
and Pluto (Hades), who became lords of the ocean and of the world
of the spirits of the dead; for on the sea and on death
Time&rsquo;s tooth has no power.&nbsp; However, Saturn&rsquo;s
reign was thought to have been a very peaceful and happy
one.&nbsp; For as people always think of the days of Paradise,
and believe that the days of old were better than their own
times, so the Greeks thought there had been four ages&mdash;the
Golden age, the Silver age, the Brazen age, and the Iron
age&mdash;and that people had been getting worse in each of
them.&nbsp; Poor old Saturn, after the Silver age, had had to go
into retirement, with only his own star, the planet Saturn, left
to him; and Jupiter was reigning now, on his throne on Olympus,
at the head of the twelve greater gods and goddesses, and it was
the Iron age down below.&nbsp; His star, the planet we still call
by his name, was much larger and brighter than Saturn.&nbsp;
Jupiter was always thought of by the Greeks as a majestic-looking
man in his full strength, with thick hair and beard, and with
lightnings in his hand and an eagle by his side.&nbsp; These
lightnings or thunderbolts were forged by his crooked son Vulcan
(Heph&aelig;stion), the god of fire, the smith and armourer of
Olympus, whose smithies were in the volcanoes (so called from his
name), and whose workmen were the Cyclops or Round
Eyes&mdash;giants, each with one eye in the middle of his
forehead.&nbsp; Once, indeed, Jupiter had needed his bolts, for
the Titans, a horrible race of <!-- page 14--><a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>monstrous
giants, of whom the worst was Briareus, who had a hundred hands,
had tried, by piling up mountains one upon the other, to scale
heaven and throw him down; but when Jupiter was hardest pressed,
a dreadful pain in his head caused him to bid Vulcan to strike it
with his hammer.&nbsp; Then out darted Heavenly Wisdom, his
beautiful daughter Pallas Athene or Minerva, fully armed, with
piercing, shining eyes, and by her counsels he cast down the
Titans, and heaped their own mountains, Etna and Ossa and Pelion,
on them to keep them down; and whenever there was an earthquake,
it was thought to be caused by one of these giants struggling to
get free, though perhaps there was some remembrance of the tower
of Babel in the story.&nbsp; Pallas, this glorious daughter of
Jupiter, was wise, brave, and strong, and she was also the
goddess of women&rsquo;s works&mdash;of all spinning, weaving,
and sewing.</p>
<p><!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>Jupiter&rsquo;s wife, the queen of heaven or the air,
was Juno&mdash;in Greek, Hera&mdash;the white-armed, ox-eyed,
stately lady, whose bird was the peacock.&nbsp; Do you know how
the peacock got the eyes in his tail?&nbsp; They once belonged to
Argus, a shepherd with a hundred eyes, whom Juno had set to watch
a cow named Io, who was really a lady, much hated by her.&nbsp;
Argus watched till Mercury (Hermes) came and lulled him to sleep
with soft music, and then drove Io away.&nbsp; Juno was so angry,
that she caused all the eyes to be taken from Argus and put into
her peacock&rsquo;s tail.</p>
<p>Mercury has a planet called after him too, a very small one,
so close to the sun that we only see it just after sunset or
before sunrise.&nbsp; I believe Mercury or Hermes really meant
the morning breeze.&nbsp; The story went that he was born early
in the morning in a cave, and after he had slept a little while
in his cradle, he came forth, and, finding the shell of a
tortoise with some strings of the inwards stretched across it, he
at once began to play on it, and thus formed the first
lyre.&nbsp; He was so swift that he was the messenger of Jupiter,
and he is always represented with wings on his cap and sandals;
but as the wind not only makes music, but blows things away
unawares, so Mercury came to be viewed not only as the god of
fair speech, but as a terrible thief, and the god of
thieves.&nbsp; You see, as long as these Greek stories are
parables, they are grand and beautiful; but when the beings are
looked on as like men, they are absurd and often horrid.&nbsp;
The gods had <!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>another messenger, Iris, the rainbow,
who always carried messages of mercy, a recollection of the bow
in the clouds; but she chiefly belonged to Juno.</p>
<p>All the twelve greater gods had palaces on Olympus, and met
every day in Jupiter&rsquo;s hall to feast on ambrosia, a sort of
food of life which made them immortal.&nbsp; Their drink was
nectar, which was poured into their golden cups at first by
Vulcan, but he stumbled and hobbled so with his lame leg that
they chose instead the fresh and graceful Hebe, the goddess of
youth, till she was careless, and one day fell down, cup and
nectar and all.&nbsp; The gods thought they must find another
cupbearer, and, looking down, they saw a beautiful youth named
Ganymede watching his flocks upon Mount Ida.&nbsp; So they sent
Jupiter&rsquo;s eagle down to fly away with him and bring him up
to Olympus.&nbsp; They gave him some ambrosia to make him
immortal, and established him as their cupbearer.&nbsp; Besides
this, the gods were thought to feed on the smoke and smell of the
sacrifices people offered up to them on earth, and always to help
those who offered them most sacrifices of animals and
incense.</p>
<p>The usual names of these twelve were&mdash;Jupiter, Neptune,
Juno, Latona, Apollo, Diana, Pallas, Venus, Vulcan, Mercury,
Vesta, and Ceres; but there were multitudes
besides&mdash;&ldquo;gods many and lords many&rdquo; of all sorts
of different dignities.&nbsp; Every river had its god, every
mountain and wood was full of nymphs, and there was a great god
of all nature called Pan, which in Greek <!-- page 17--><a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>means
All.&nbsp; Neptune was only a visitor in Olympus, though he had a
right there.&nbsp; His kingdom was the sea, which he ruled with
his trident, and where he had a whole world of lesser gods and
nymphs, tritons and sea horses, to attend upon his chariot.</p>
<p>And the quietest and best of all the goddesses was Vesta, the
goddess of the household hearth&mdash;of home, that is to
say.&nbsp; There are no stories to be told about her, but a fire
was always kept burning in her honour in each city, and no one
might tend it who was not good and pure.</p>

and goddess of light were the glorious twin brother and sister,
Ph&oelig;bus Apollo and Diana or Artemis.&nbsp; They were born in
the isle of Delos, which was caused to rise out of the sea to
save their mother, Latona, from the horrid serpent, Python, who
wanted to devour her.&nbsp; Gods were born strong and mighty; and
the first thing Apollo did was to slay the serpent at Delphi with
his arrows.&nbsp; Here was a dim remembrance of the promise that
the Seed of the woman should bruise the serpent&rsquo;s head, and
also a thought of the way Light slays the dragon of darkness with
his beams.&nbsp; Apollo was lord of the day, and Diana queen of
the night.&nbsp; They were as bright and pure as the thought of
man could make them, and always young.&nbsp; The beams or rays
were their arrows, and so Diana was a huntress, always in the
woods with her nymphs; and she was so modest, that once, when an
unfortunate wanderer, named Act&aelig;on, came on her with her
nymphs by chance when they were bathing in a stream, she splashed
some water in his face and turned him into a <!-- page 19--><a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>stag, so that
his own dogs gave chase to him and killed him.&nbsp; I am afraid
Apollo and Diana were rather cruel; but the darting rays of the
sun and moon kill sometimes as well as bless; and so they were
the senders of all sharp, sudden strokes.&nbsp; There was a queen
called Niobe, who had six sons and daughters so bright and fair
that she boasted that they were equal to Apollo and Diana, which
made Latona so angry, that she sent her son and daughter to slay
them all with their darts.&nbsp; The unhappy Niobe, thus punished
for her impiety, wept a river of tears till she was turned into
stone.</p>

like manner, to Apollo, though he did not drive the car himself,
but Helios, the sun-god, did.&nbsp; The world was thought to be a
flat plate, with Delphi in the middle, and the ocean all
round.&nbsp; In the far east the lady dawn, Aurora, or E&ocirc;s,
opened the gates with her rosy fingers, and out came the golden
car of the sun, with glorious white horses driven by Helios,
attended by the Hours strewing dew and flowers.&nbsp; It passed
over the arch of the heavens to the ocean again on the west, and
there Aurora met it again in fair colours, took out the horses,
and let them feed.&nbsp; Aurora had married a man named
Tithonus.&nbsp; She gave him ambrosia, which made him immortal,
but she could not keep him from growing old, so he became smaller
and smaller, till he dwindled into a grasshopper, and at last
only his voice was to be heard chirping at sunrise and
sunset.</p>
<p>Helios had an earthly wife too, and a son named Pha&euml;ton,
who once begged to be allowed to drive the chariot of the sun for
just one day.&nbsp; Helios yielded; but poor Pha&euml;ton had no
strength nor skill to guide the horses in the right curve.&nbsp;
At one moment they rushed to the earth and scorched the trees, at
another they flew up to heaven and would have burnt Olympus, if
Jupiter had not cast his thunderbolts at the rash driver and
hurled him down into a river, where he was drowned.&nbsp; His
sisters wept till they were changed into poplar trees, and their
tears hardened into amber drops.</p>

music and poetry, and under him were nine nymphs&mdash;the Muses,
daughters of memory&mdash;who dwelt on Mount Parnassus, and were
thought to inspire all noble and heroic song, all poems in praise
to or of the gods or of brave men, and the graceful music and
dancing at their feasts, also the knowledge of the stars of earth
and heaven.</p>

</a>These three&mdash;Apollo, Diana, and Pallas&mdash;were the
gods of all that was nobly, purely, and wisely lovely; but the
Greeks also believed in powers of ill, and there was a goddess of
beauty, called Venus (Aphrodite).&nbsp; Such beauty was hers as
is the mere prettiness and charm of pleasure&mdash;nothing high
or fine.&nbsp; She was said to have risen out of the sea, as the
sunshine touched the waves, with her golden hair dripping with
the spray; and her favourite home was in myrtle groves, where she
drove her car, drawn by doves, attended by the three Graces, and
by multitudes of little winged children, called Loves; but there
was generally said to be one special <!-- page 22--><a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>son of hers,
called Love&mdash;Cupid in Latin, Eros in Greek&mdash;whose
arrows, when tipped with gold, made people fall in love, and when
tipped with lead, made them hate one another.&nbsp; Her husband
was the ugly, crooked smith, Vulcan&mdash;perhaps because pretty
ornaments come of the hard work of the smith; but she never
behaved well to him, and only coaxed him when she wanted
something that his clever hands could make.</p>
<p>She was much more fond of amusing herself with Mars (Ares),
the god of war, another of the evil gods, for he was fierce,
cruel, and violent, and where he went slaughter and blood were
sure to follow him and his horrid daughter Bellona.&nbsp; His
star was &ldquo;the red planet Mars;&rdquo; but Venus had the
beautiful clear one, which, according as it is seen either at
sunrise or sunset, is called the morning or evening star.&nbsp;
Venus also loved a beautiful young earthly youth, called Adonis,
who died of a thrust from a wild boar&rsquo;s tusk, while his
blood stained crimson the pretty flower, pheasant&rsquo;s eye,
which is still called Adonis.&nbsp; Venus was so wretched that
she persuaded Jupiter to decree that Adonis should come back and
live for one-half of the year, but he was to go down to
Pluto&rsquo;s underground kingdom the other half.&nbsp; This is
because plants and flowers are beautiful for one year, die down,
and rise again.</p>

</a>But there is a much prettier story, with something of the
same meaning, about Ceres (Demeter), the grave, motherly goddess
of corn and all the fruits of the earth.&nbsp; <!-- page 23--><a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>She had one
fair daughter, named Proserpine (Persephone), who was playing
with her companions near Mount Etna, gathering flowers in the
meadows, when grim old Pluto pounced upon her and carried her off
into his underground world to be his bride.&nbsp; Poor Ceres did
not know what had become of her darling, and wandered up and down
the world seeking for her, tasting no food or drink, till at
last, quite spent, she was taken in as a poor woman by Celeus,
king of Eleusis, and became nurse to his infant child
Triptolemus.&nbsp; All Eleusis was made rich with corn, while no
rain fell and no crops grew on the rest of the earth; and though
first Iris and then all the gods came to beg Ceres to relent, she
would grant nothing unless she had her daughter back.&nbsp; So
Jupiter sent Mercury to bring Proserpine home; but she was only
to be allowed to stay on earth on condition that she had eaten
nothing while in the under world.&nbsp; Pluto, knowing this, had
made her eat half a pomegranate, and so she could not stay with
her mother; but Ceres&rsquo;s tears prevailed so far that she was
to spend the summer above ground and the winter below.&nbsp; For
she really was the flowers and fruit.&nbsp; Ceres had grown so
fond of little Triptolemus that she wanted to make him immortal;
but, as she had no ambrosia, this could only be done by <!-- page
24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>putting him on the fire night after night to burn away
his mortal part.&nbsp; His mother looked in one night during the
operation, and shrieked so that she prevented it; so all Ceres
could do for him was to give him grains of wheat and a dragon
car, with which he travelled all about the world, teaching men to
sow corn and reap harvests.</p>
<p>Proserpine seems to have been contented in her underground
kingdom, where she ruled with Pluto.&nbsp; It was supposed to be
below the volcanic grounds in southern Italy, near Lake
Avernus.&nbsp; The entrance to it was guarded by a three-headed
dog, named Cerberus, and the way to it was barred by the River
Styx.&nbsp; Every evening Mercury brought all the spirits of the
people who had died during the day to the shore of the Styx, and
if their funeral rites had been properly performed, and they had
a little coin on the tongue to pay the fare, Charon, the
ferryman, took them across; but if their corpses were in the sea,
or on battle-fields, unburied, the poor shades had to flit about
vainly begging to be ferried over.&nbsp; After they had crossed,
they were judged by three judges, and if they had been wicked,
were sent over the river of fire to be tormented by the three
Furies, Alecto, Megara, and Tisiphone, who had snakes as scourges
and in their hair.&nbsp; If they had been brave and virtuous,
they were allowed to live among beautiful trees and flowers in
the Elysian fields, where Pluto reigned; but they seem always to
have longed after the life they had lost; and these Greek <!--
page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>notions of bliss seem sad besides what we know to be the
truth.&nbsp; Here, too, lived the three Fates, always spinning
the threads of men&rsquo;s lives; Clotho held the distaff,
Lachesis drew out the thread, and Atropos with her shears cut it
off when the man was to die.&nbsp; And, though Jupiter was
mighty, nothing could happen but by Fate, which was stronger than
he.</p>

remember the Titans who rebelled against Jupiter.&nbsp; There was
one who was noble, and wise, and kind, who did not rebel, and
kept his brother from doing so.&nbsp; His name was Prometheus,
which means Forethought; his brother&rsquo;s was Epimetheus, or
Afterthought; their father was Iapetus.&nbsp; When all the other
Titans had been buried under the rocks, Jupiter bade Prometheus
mould men out of the mud, and call on the winds of heaven to
breathe life into them.&nbsp; Then Prometheus loved the beings he
had made, and taught them to build houses, and tame the animals,
and row and sail on the sea, and study the stars.&nbsp; But Zeus
was afraid they would be too mighty, and would not give them
fire.&nbsp; Then Prometheus climbed the skies, and brought fire
down for them in a hollow reed.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The gods were jealous, and thought it time to stop this.&nbsp;
So Jupiter bade Vulcan mould a woman out of clay, and Pallas to
adorn her with all charms and gifts, so that she was called
Pandora, or All Gifts; and they gave her a casket, into which
they had put all pains, and <!-- page 27--><a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>griefs, and
woes, and ills, and nothing good in it but hope; and they sent
her down to visit the two Titan brothers.&nbsp; Prometheus knew
that Jupiter hated them, and he had warned Epimetheus not to take
any gift that came from Olympus; but he was gone from home when
Pandora came; and when Epimetheus saw how lovely she was, and
heard her sweet voice, he was won over to trust her, and to open
the box.&nbsp; Then out flew all the evils and miseries that were
stored in it, and began to torment poor mankind with war, and
<!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>sickness, and thirst, and hunger, and nothing good was
left but hope at the bottom of the box.&nbsp; And by-and-by there
came spirits, called Prayers, but they were lame, coming after
evil, because people are so apt not to begin to pray till harm
has befallen them.</p>
<p>
<a href="images/p28.jpg">
<img class="floatleft" alt=
"Pandora"
title=
"Pandora"
src="images/p28.jpg" />
</a>The gods undertook also to accept sacrifices, claiming a
share in whatever animal man slew.&nbsp; Prometheus guarded his
people here by putting the flesh of a bullock on one side, and
the bones and inward parts covered with the fat on the other, and
bidding Jupiter choose which should be his.&nbsp; The fat looked
as if the heap it covered were the best, and Jupiter chose that,
and was forced to abide by his choice; so that, whenever a beast
was killed for food, the bones and fat were burnt on the altar,
and man had the flesh.&nbsp; All this made Jupiter so angry,
that, as Prometheus was immortal and could not be killed, he
chained the great, good Titan to a rock on Mount Caucasus, and
sent an eagle continually to rend his side and tear out his liver
as fast as it grew again; but Prometheus, in all his agony, kept
hope, for he knew that deliverance would come to him; and, in the
meantime, he was still the comforter and counsellor of all who
found their way to him.</p>
<p>Men grew very wicked, owing to the evils in <!-- page 29--><a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>Pandora&rsquo;s box, and Jupiter resolved to drown them
all with a flood; but Prometheus, knowing it beforehand, told his
mortal son Deucalion to build a ship and store it with all sorts
of food.&nbsp; In it Deucalion and his wife Pyrrha floated about
for nine days till all men had been drowned, and as the waters
went down the ship rested on Mount Parnassus, and Deucalion and
Pyrrha came out and offered sacrifices to Jupiter.&nbsp; He was
appeased, and sent Mercury down to ask what he should grant
them.&nbsp; Their prayer was that the earth might be filled again
with people, upon which the god bade them walk up the hill and
throw behind them the bones of their grandmother.&nbsp; Now Earth
was said to be the mother of the Titans, so the bones of their
grandmother were the rocks, so as they went they picked up stones
and threw them over their shoulders.&nbsp; All those that
Deucalion threw rose up as men, and all those that Pyrrha threw
became women, and thus the earth was alive again with human
beings.&nbsp; No one can fail to see what far older histories
must have been brought in the minds of the Greeks, and have been
altered into these tales, which have much beauty in
themselves.&nbsp; The story of the flood seems to have been mixed
up with some small later inundation which only affected
Greece.</p>
<p>The proper old name of Greece was Hellas, and the people whom
we call Greeks called themselves Hell&ecirc;nes. <a
name="citation29"></a><a href="#footnote29"
class="citation">[29]</a>&nbsp; Learned men know that they, like
all the people of Europe, and also the Persians and Hindoos,
sprang <!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>from one great family of the sons of
Japhet, called Arians.&nbsp; A tribe called Pelasgi came first,
and lived in Asia Minor, Greece, and Italy; and after them came
the Hell&ecirc;nes, who were much quicker and cleverer than <!--
page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>the Pelasgi, and became their masters in most of
Greece.&nbsp; So that the people we call Greeks were a mixture of
the two, and they were divided into three lesser tribes&mdash;the
&AElig;olians, Dorians, and Ionians.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p30.jpg">
<img alt=
"The World according to the Greeks"
title=

src="images/p30.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Now, having told you that bit of truth, I will go back to what
the Greeks thought.&nbsp; They said that Deucalion had a son
whose name was Hell&ecirc;n, and that he again had three sons,
called &AElig;olus, Dorus, and Xuthus.&nbsp; &AElig;olus was the
father of the &AElig;olian Greeks, and some in after times
thought that he was the same with the god called &AElig;olus, who
was thought to live in the Lipari Islands; and these keep guard
over the spirits of the winds&mdash;Boreas, the rough, lively
north wind; Auster, the rainy south wind; Eurus, the bitter east;
and Zephyr, the gentle west.&nbsp; He kept them in a cave, and
let one out according to the way the wind was wanted to blow, or
if there was to be a storm he sent out two at once to struggle,
and fight, and roar together, and lash up Neptune&rsquo;s world,
the sea.&nbsp; The &AElig;olians did chiefly live in the islands
and at Corinth.&nbsp; One of the sons of &AElig;olus turned out
very badly, and cheated Jupiter.&nbsp; His name was Sisyphus, and
he was punished in Tartarus&mdash;Pluto&rsquo;s world
below&mdash;by having always to roll a stone up a mountain so
steep that it was sure to come down upon him again.</p>
<p>Dorus was, of course, the father of the Dorians; and Xuthus
had a son, called I&ocirc;n, who was the father of the
Ionians.&nbsp; But, besides all these, there was a story of two
brothers, named &AElig;gyptus and Danaus, one of <!-- page
32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>whom
settled in Egypt, and the other in Argos.&nbsp; One had fifty
sons and the other fifty daughters, and &AElig;gyptus decreed
that they should all marry; but Danaus and his daughters hated
their cousins, and the father gave each bride a dagger, with
which she stabbed her bridegroom.&nbsp; Only one had pity, and
though the other forty-nine were not punished here, yet, when
they died and went to Tartarus, they did not escape, but were
obliged to be for ever trying to carry water in bottomless
vessels.&nbsp; The people of Argos called themselves Danai, and
no doubt some of them came from Egypt.</p>
<p>One more story, and a very strange one, tells of the peopling
of Greece.&nbsp; A fair lady, named Europa, was playing in the
meadows on the Ph&oelig;nician coast, when a great white bull
came to her, let his horns be wreathed with flowers, lay down,
and invited her to mount his back; but no sooner had she done so,
than he rose and trotted down with her to the sea, and swam with
her out of sight.&nbsp; He took her, in fact, to the island of
Crete, where her son Minos was so good and just a king, that,
when he died, Pluto appointed him and two others to be judges of
the spirits of the dead.&nbsp; Europe was called after Europa, as
the loss of her led settlers there from Asia.&nbsp;
Europa&rsquo;s family grieved for her, and her father, mother,
and brother went everywhere in search of her.&nbsp; Cadmus was
the name of her brother, and he and his mother went far and wide,
till the mother died, and Cadmus went to Delphi&mdash;the <!--
page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>place thought to be the centre of the earth&mdash;where
Apollo had slain the serpent Python, and where he had a temple
and cavern in which every question could be answered.&nbsp; Such
places of divination were called oracles, and Cadmus was here
told to cease from seeking his sister, and to follow a cow till
she fell down with fatigue, and to build a city on that
spot.&nbsp; The poor cow went till she came into B&oelig;otia,
and there fell.&nbsp; Cadmus meant to offer her up, and went to
fetch water from a fountain near, but as he stooped a fierce
dragon rushed on him.&nbsp; He had a hard fight to kill it, but
Pallas shone out in her beauty on him, and bade him sow its teeth
in the ground.&nbsp; He did so, and they sprung up as warriors,
who at once began to fight, and killed one another, all but five,
who made friends, and helped Cadmus to build the famous city
called Thebes.&nbsp; It is strange, after so wild a story as
this, to be told that Cadmus first taught writing in Greece, and
brought the alphabet of sixteen letters.&nbsp; The Greek alphabet
was really learnt from the Ph&oelig;nicians, and most likely the
whole is a curious story of some settlement of that eastern
people in Greece.&nbsp; Most likely they brought in the worship
of the wine-god, Bacchus (Dionysos), for he was called
Cadmus&rsquo;s grandson.&nbsp; An orphan at first, he was brought
up by the nymphs and Mercury, and then became a great conqueror,
going to India, and Egypt, and everywhere, carrying the vine and
teaching the use of wine.&nbsp; He was attended by an old fat
man, named Silenus, and by creatures, called Fauns and Satyrs,
<!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>like men with goats&rsquo; ears and legs; his crown was
of ivy, and his chariot was drawn by leopards, and he was at last
raised to Olympus.&nbsp; His feasts were called orgies; he-goats
were sacrificed at them, and songs were sung, after which there
was much drinking, and people danced holding sticks wreathed with
vine and ivy leaves.&nbsp; The women who danced were called
Bacchanals.&nbsp; The better sort of Greeks at first would not
adopt these shameful rites.&nbsp; There were horrid stories of
women who refused them going mad and leaping into the sea, and
the Bacchanals used to fall upon and destroy all who resisted
them.</p>

means a great and glorious man, and the Greeks thought they had
many such among their forefathers&mdash;nay, that they were sons
of gods, and themselves, after many trials and troubles, became
gods, since these Greeks of old felt that &ldquo;we are also His
offspring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here is a story of one of these heroes.&nbsp; His mother was
the daughter of an Argive king, and was named Dana&euml;.&nbsp;
He was named Perseus, and had bright eyes and golden hair like
the morning.&nbsp; When he was a little babe, he and his mother
were out at sea, and were cast on the isle of Seriphos, where a
fisherman named Dictys took care of them.&nbsp; A cruel tyrant
named Polydectes wanted Dana&euml; to be his wife, and, as she
would not consent, he shut her up in prison, saying that she
should never come out till her son Perseus had brought him the
head of the Gorgon Medusa, thinking he must be lost by the
way.&nbsp; For the Gorgons were three terrible sisters, who lived
in the far west beyond the setting sun.&nbsp; Two of them were
immortal, and had dragon&rsquo;s wings and brazen claws and
serpent hair, but their sister Medusa was mortal, and so <!--
page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>beautiful in the face that she had boasted of being
fairer than Pallas.&nbsp; To punish her presumption, her hair was
turned to serpents, and whosoever looked on her face, sad and
lovely as it was, would instantly be turned into stone.</p>
<p>But, for his mother&rsquo;s sake, young Perseus was resolved
to dare this terrible adventure, and his bravery brought help
from the gods.&nbsp; The last night before he was to set out
Pallas came and showed him the images of the three Gorgons, and
bade him not concern himself about the two he could not kill; but
she gave him a mirror of polished brass, and told him only to
look at Medusa&rsquo;s reflection on it, for he would become a
stone if he beheld her real self.&nbsp; Then Mercury came and
gave Perseus a sword of light that would cleave all on whom it
might fall, lent him his own winged sandals, and told him to go
first to the nymphs of the Grai&aelig;, the Gorgons&rsquo;
sisters, and make them tell him the way.</p>
<p>So the young hero went by land and sea, still westwards, to
the very borders of the world, where stands the giant of the
west, Atlas, holding up the great vault of the skies on his broad
shoulders.&nbsp; Beyond lay the dreary land of twilight, on the
shores of the great ocean that goes round the world, and on the
rocks on the shores sat the three old, old nymphs, the
Grai&aelig;, who had been born with grey hair, and had but one
eye and one tooth among them, which they passed to one another in
turn.&nbsp; When the first had seen the noble-looking youth
speeding to them, she handed her eye on, that the next sister
might look at him; but Perseus was <!-- page 37--><a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>too
quick&mdash;he caught the one eye out of her hand, and then told
the three poor old nymphs that he did not want to hurt them, but
that he must keep their eye till they had told him the way to
Medusa the Gorgon.</p>
<p>They told him the way, and, moreover, they gave him a mist-cap
helmet from Tartarus, which would make him invisible whenever he
put it on, and also a bag, which he slung on his back; and, thus
armed, he went further to the very bounds of the world, and he
took his mirror in his hand, and looked into it.&nbsp; There he
saw the three Gorgon sisters, their necks covered with scales
like those of snakes (at least those of two), their teeth like
boar&rsquo;s tusks, their hands like brass, and their wings of
gold; but they were all fast asleep, and Perseus, still looking
into his mirror, cleft Medusa&rsquo;s neck with his all-cutting
sword, and put her head into the bag on his back without ever
seeing her face.&nbsp; Her sisters awoke and darted after him;
but he put on his helmet of mist, and they lost him, while he
fled away on Mercury&rsquo;s swift-winged sandals.&nbsp; As he
sped eastward, he heard a voice asking whether he had really
killed the Gorgon.&nbsp; It was Atlas, the old heaven-supporting
giant; and when Perseus answered that he had, Atlas declared that
he must see the head to convince him.&nbsp; So Perseus put a hand
over his shoulder, and drew it up by its snaky hair; but no
sooner had Atlas cast his eyes on it than he turned into a
mountain, his white beard and hair becoming the snowy peak, and
his garments the woods and forests.&nbsp; And there he still <!--
page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

map-books are named after him.</p>

<a href="images/p38.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>But Perseus&rsquo; adventures were not over.&nbsp; As he flew
on by the Lybian coast he heard a sound of wailing, and beheld a
beautiful maiden chained by her hands and feet to a rock.&nbsp;
He asked what had led her to this sad plight, and she answered
that she was Andromeda, the daughter of Cepheus and Cassiopeia,
king and <!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>queen of Ethiopia, and that her
mother had foolishly boasted that she was fairer than the
Nereids, the fifty nymphs who are the spirits of the waves.&nbsp;
Neptune was so much displeased that he sent a flood to overflow
the land, and a sea-monster to devour the people and
cattle.&nbsp; In an oasis or isle of fertility in the middle of
the Lybian desert was a temple of Jupiter, there called Ammon,
and the Ethiopians had sent there to ask what to do.&nbsp; The
oracle replied that the evil should cease if Andromeda were given
up to the monster.&nbsp; Cepheus had been obliged to yield her up
because of the outcries of the people, and here she was waiting
to be devoured.&nbsp; Perseus, of course, was ready.&nbsp; He
heard the monster coming, bade Andromeda close her eyes, and then
held up the Gorgon&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; In an instant her foe had
become a rock, and he cleft the maiden&rsquo;s chains, brought
her back to her father and mother, who gave her to him in
marriage, and made a great feast; but here a former lover of hers
insulted them both so much, that Perseus was forced to show him
the Gorgon&rsquo;s face, and turn him into stone.</p>
<p>Then Perseus, with Andromeda, took his way to Seriphos.&nbsp;
Indeed it was high time that he should come back, for Polydectes,
thinking that he must long ago have been turned into a rock at
the sight of Medusa, had tried to take Dana&euml; by force to be
his wife, and she had fled into a temple, where no one dared to
touch her, since it was always believed that the gods punished
such as dragged suppliants away <!-- page 40--><a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>from their
temples.&nbsp; So Perseus went to Polydectes, who was in the
midst of a feast, and, telling him that his bidding was done,
held up the head of Medusa, and of course the king and his whole
court turned at once into stone.&nbsp; Now that the work of the
Gorgon&rsquo;s head was done, Perseus offered it to Pallas, who
placed it upon her shield, or, as it is always called, her
&aelig;gis; and he gave back the sword of light, cap of mist, and
winged sandals to Mercury.</p>
<p>After this he returned to Argos, and there, at a game of
quoits, he had the misfortune to throw the quoit the wrong way,
and hit his grandfather, the king, so as to kill him.&nbsp;
Perseus reigned afterwards, and, like all the nobler Greek
heroes, kept out the worship of Bacchus and its foul orgies from
his dominions; but he afterwards exchanged kingdoms with another
king, and built the city of Tiryas.&nbsp; He lived happily with
Andromeda, and had a great many children, whose descendants
viewed him as a demi-god, and had shrines to him, where they
offered incense and sacrifice; for they thought that he and all
the family were commemorated in the stars, and named the groups
after them.&nbsp; You may find them all in the North.&nbsp;
Andromeda is a great square, as if large stars marked the rivets
of her chains on the rock; Perseus, a long curved cluster of
bright stars, as if climbing up to deliver her; her mother
Cassiopeia like a bright W, in which the Greeks traced a chair,
where she sat with her back to the rest to punish her for her
boast.&nbsp; Cepheus is there too, but he <!-- page 41--><a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>is smaller,
and less easy to find.&nbsp; They are all in the North, round the
Great Bear, who was said by the Greeks to be a poor lady whom
Juno had turned into a bear, and who was almost killed
unknowingly by her own son when out hunting.&nbsp; He is the
Little Bear, with the pole star in his tail, and she is the Great
Bear, always circling round him, and, as the Greeks used to say,
never dipping her muzzle into the ocean, because she is so far
north that she never sets.</p>
<p>This story of Perseus is a very old one, which all nations
have loved to tell, though with different names.&nbsp; You will
be amused to think that the old Cornish way of telling it is
found in &ldquo;Jack the Giant-Killer,&rdquo; who had
seven-leagued boots and a cap of mist, and delivered fair ladies
from their cruel foes.</p>

morning Jupiter boasted among the gods in Olympus that a son
would that day be born in the line of Perseus, who would rule
over all the Argives.&nbsp; Juno was angry and jealous at this,
and, as she was the goddess who presided over the births of
children, she contrived to hinder the birth of the child he
intended till that day was over, and to hasten that of another
grandson of the great Perseus.&nbsp; This child was named
Eurystheus, and, as he had been born on the right day, Jupiter
was forced to let him be king of Argos, Sparta, and Mycen&aelig;,
and all the Dorian race; while the boy whom he had meant to be
the chief was kept in subjection, in spite of having wonderful
gifts of courage and strength, and a kind, generous nature, that
always was ready to help the weak and sorrowful.</p>

<p>His name was Alcides, or Hercules, and he was so strong at ten
months old, that, with his own hands, he strangled two serpents
whom Juno sent to devour him in his cradle.&nbsp; He was bred up
by Chiron, the chief of the Centaurs, a wondrous race of beings,
who had horses&rsquo; <!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>bodies as far as the forelegs, but
where the neck of the horse would begin had human breasts and
shoulders, with arms and heads.&nbsp; Most of them were fierce
and savage; but Chiron was very wise and good, and, as Jupiter
made him immortal, he was the teacher of many of the great Greek
heroes.&nbsp; When Hercules was about eighteen, two maidens
appeared to him&mdash;one in a simple white dress, grave, modest
and seemly; the other scarcely clothed, but tricked out in
ornaments, with a flushed face, and bold, roving eyes.&nbsp; The
first told him that she <!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>was Virtue, and that, if he would
follow her, she would lead him through many hard trials, but that
he would be glorious at last, and be blest among the gods.&nbsp;
The other was Vice, and she tried to wile him by a smooth life
among wine-cups and dances and flowers and sports, all to be
enjoyed at once.&nbsp; But the choice of Hercules was Virtue, and
it was well for him, for Jupiter, to make up for Juno&rsquo;s
cheat, had sworn that, if he fulfilled twelve tasks which
Eurystheus should put upon him, he should be declared worthy of
being raised to the gods at his death.</p>

45</span>Eurystheus did not know that in giving these tasks he
was making his cousin fulfil his course; but he was afraid of
such a mighty man, and hoped that one of these would be the means
of getting rid of him.&nbsp; So when he saw Hercules at Argos,
with a club made of a forest tree in his hand, and clad in the
skin of a lion which he had slain, Eurystheus bade him go and
kill a far more terrible lion, of giant brood, and with a skin
that could not be pierced, which dwelt in the valley of
Nemea.&nbsp; The fight was a terrible one; the lion could not be
wounded, and Hercules was forced to grapple with it, and strangle
it in his arms.&nbsp; He lost a finger in the struggle, but at
last the beast died in his grasp, and he carried it on his back
to Argos, where Eurystheus was so much frightened at the grim
sight that he fled away to hide himself, and commanded Hercules
not to bring his monsters within the gates of the city.</p>
<p>
<a href="images/p45.jpg">
<img class="floatright" alt=

</a>There was a second labour ready for Hercules&mdash;namely,
the destroying a serpent with nine heads, called Hydra, whose
lair was the marsh of Lerna.&nbsp; Hercules went to the battle,
and managed to crush one head with his club, but that moment two
sprang up in its place; moreover, a huge crab came out of the
swamp, and began to pinch his heels.&nbsp; Still he did not lose
heart, but, calling his friend Iolaus, he bade him take a <!--
page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>fire-brand and burn the necks as fast as he cut off the
heads; and thus at last they killed the creature, and Hercules
dipped his arrows in its poisonous blood, so that their least
wound became fatal.&nbsp; Eurystheus said that it had not been a
fair victory, since Hercules had been helped, and Juno put the
crab into the skies as the constellation Cancer; while a labour
to patience was next devised for Hercules&mdash;namely, the
chasing of the Arcadian stag, which was sacred to Diana, and had
golden horns and brazen hoofs.&nbsp; Hercules hunted it up hill
and down dale for a whole year, and when at last he caught it, he
got into trouble with Apollo and Diana about it, and had hard
work to appease them; but he did so at last; and for his fourth
labour was sent to catch alive a horrid wild boar on Mount
Erymanthus.&nbsp; He followed the beast through a deep swamp,
caught it in a net, and brought it to Mycen&aelig;.</p>
<p>
<a href="images/p46.jpg">
<img class="floatleft" alt=
"Hercules fighting the Hydra"
title=

src="images/p46.jpg" />
</a>The fifth task was a curious one.&nbsp; Augeas, king of Elis,
had immense herds, and kept his stables and cow-houses in a
frightful state of filth, and Eurystheus, hoping either to
disgust Hercules or kill him by the unwholesomeness of the work,
sent him to clean them.&nbsp; Hercules, without telling Augeas it
was his appointed <!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>task, offered to do it if he were
repaid the tenth of the herds, and received the promise on
oath.&nbsp; Then he dug a canal, and turned the water of two
rivers into the stables, so as effectually to cleanse them; but
when Augeas heard it was his task, he tried to cheat him of the
payment, and on the other hand Eurystheus said, as he had been
rewarded, it could not count as one of his labours, and ordered
him off to clear the woods near Lake Stymphalis of some horrible
birds, with brazen beaks and claws, and ready-made arrows for
feathers, which ate human flesh.&nbsp; To get them to rise out of
the forest was his first difficulty, but Pallas lent him a brazen
clapper, which made them take to their wings; then he shot them
with his poisoned arrows, killed many, and drove the rest
away.</p>
<p>King Minos of Crete had once vowed to sacrifice to the gods
whatever should appear from the sea.&nbsp; A beautiful white bull
came, so fine that it tempted him not to keep his word, and he
was punished by the bull going mad, and doing all sorts of damage
in Crete; so that Eurystheus thought it would serve as a labour
for Hercules to bring the animal to Mycen&aelig;.&nbsp; In due
time back came the hero, with the bull, quite subdued, upon his
shoulders; and, having shown it, he let it loose again to run
about Greece.</p>
<p>He had a harder task in getting the mares of the Thracian
king, Diom&ecirc;des, which were fed on man&rsquo;s flesh.&nbsp;
He overcame their grooms, and drove the beasts away; but he was
overtaken by Diom&ecirc;des, and, while fighting with him and his
people, put the mares under <!-- page 48--><a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>the charge of
a friend; but when the battle was over, and Diom&ecirc;des
killed, he found that they had eaten up their keeper.&nbsp;
However, when he had fed them on the dead body of their late
master, they grew mild and manageable, and he brought them
home.</p>
<p>The next expedition was against the Amazons, a nation of women
warriors, who lived somewhere on the banks of the Euxine or Black
Sea, kept their husbands in subjection, and seldom brought up a
son.&nbsp; The bravest of all the Amazons was the queen,
Hippolyta, to whom Mars had given a belt as a reward for her
valour.&nbsp; Eurystheus&rsquo; daughter wanted this belt, and
Hercules was sent to fetch it.&nbsp; He was so hearty, honest,
and good-natured, that he talked over Hippolyta, and she promised
him her girdle; but Juno, to make mischief, took the form of an
Amazon, and persuaded the ladies that their queen was being
deluded and stolen away by a strange man, so they mounted their
horses and came down to rescue her.&nbsp; He thought she had been
treacherous, and there was a great fight, in which he killed her,
and carried off her girdle.</p>
<p>Far out in the west, near the ocean flowing round the world,
were herds of purple oxen, guarded by a two-headed dog, and
belonging to a giant with three bodies called Geryon, who lived
in the isle of Erythria, in the outmost ocean.&nbsp; Passing
Lybia, Hercules came to the end of the Mediterranean Sea,
Neptune&rsquo;s domain, and there set up two
pillars&mdash;namely, Mounts Calpe and Abyla&mdash;on each side a
the Straits of Gibraltar.&nbsp; <!-- page 49--><a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>The rays of
the sun scorched him, and in wrath he shot at it with his arrows,
when Helios, instead of being angry, admired his boldness, and
gave him his golden cup, wherewith to cross the outer ocean,
which he did safely, although old Oceanus, who was king there,
put up his hoary head, and tried to frighten him by shaking the
bowl.&nbsp; It was large enough to hold all the herd of oxen,
when Hercules had killed dog, herdsman, and giant, and he
returned it safely to Helios when he had crossed the ocean.&nbsp;
The oxen were sacrificed to Juno, Eurystheus&rsquo; friend.</p>
<p>Again Eurystheus sent Hercules to the utmost parts of the
earth.&nbsp; This time it was to bring home the golden apples
which grew in the gardens of the Hesperides, the daughters of old
Atlas, who dwelt in the land of Hesperus the Evening Star, and,
together with a dragon, guarded the golden tree in a beautiful
garden.&nbsp; Hercules made a long journey, apparently round by
the North, and on his way had to wrestle with a dreadful giant
named Ant&aelig;us.&nbsp; Though thrown down over and over again,
Ant&aelig;us rose up twice as strong every time, till Hercules
found out that he grew in force whenever he touched his mother
earth, and therefore, lifting him up in those mightiest of arms,
the hero squeezed the breath out of him.&nbsp; By-and-by he came
to Mount Caucasus, where he found the chained Prometheus, and,
aiming an arrow at the eagle, killed the tormentor, and set the
Titan free.&nbsp; In return, Prometheus gave him much good
counsel, and indeed seems to have gone <!-- page 50--><a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>with him to
Atlas, who, according to this story, was still able to move, in
spite of the petrifaction by Hercules&rsquo; grandfather.&nbsp;
Atlas undertook to go to his daughters, and get the apples, if
Hercules would hold up the skies for him in the meantime.&nbsp;
Hercules agreed, and Atlas shifted the heavens to his shoulders,
went, and presently returned with three apples of gold, but said
he would take them to Eurystheus, and Hercules must continue to
bear the load of the skies.&nbsp; Prometheus bade Hercules say he
could not hold them without a pad for them to rest on his
head.&nbsp; Atlas took them again to hold while the pad was put
on; and thereupon Hercules picked up the apples, and left the old
giant to his load.</p>
<p>One more labour remained&mdash;namely, to bring up the
three-headed watch-dog, Cerberus, from the doors of
Tartarus.&nbsp; Mercury and Pallas both came to attend him, and
led him alive among the shades, who all fled from him, except
Medusa and one brave youth.&nbsp; He gave them the blood of an ox
to drink, and made his way to Pluto&rsquo;s throne, where he
asked leave to take Cerberus to the upper world with him.&nbsp;
Pluto said he might, if he could overcome Cerberus without
weapons; and this he did, struggling with the dog, with no
protection but the lion&rsquo;s skin, and dragging him up to the
light, where the foam that fell from the jaws of one of the three
mouths produced the plant called aconite, or hellebore, which is
dark and poisonous.&nbsp; After showing the beast to Eurystheus,
Hercules safely returned him to the underworld, and thus
completed his twelve great labours.</p>

<h2>CHAP. VI.&mdash;THE ARGONAUTS.</h2>
<p>
<img class='dc' alt='Y' title='Y' src='images/dcy.jpg' />ou
remember that Cadmus founded Thebes.&nbsp; One of his daughters
was named Ino.&nbsp; She married a son of King &AElig;olus, who
had been married before, and had two children, Phryxus and
Helle.&nbsp; Ino was a cruel stepmother, and deceived her husband
into thinking that the oracle at Delphi required him to sacrifice
his son to Jupiter; but as the poor boy stood before the altar,
down from the skies came a ram with a golden fleece, which took
both the children on his back, and flew away with them over land
and sea; but poor Helle let go in passing the narrow strait
between Asia and Europe, fell into the sea, and was
drowned.&nbsp; The strait was called after her, the Hellespont,
or Helle&rsquo;s Sea.&nbsp; Phryxus came safely to Colchis, on
the Black Sea, and was kindly received by &AElig;etes, the king
of the country.&nbsp; They sacrificed the golden-woolled ram to
Jupiter, and nailed up its fleece to a tree in the grove of
Mars.</p>
<p>Some time after, Pelias, the usurping king of Iolcus, was
driving a mule-car through the market-place, when he saw a fine
young man, with hair flowing <!-- page 52--><a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>on his
shoulders, two spears in his hand, and only one sandal.&nbsp; He
was very much afraid, for it had been foretold to him by an
oracle that he would be slain by the man with one foot
bare.&nbsp; And this youth was really Jason, the son of his
brother &AElig;son, from whom he had taken the kingdom.&nbsp;
Fearing that he would kill the child, &AElig;son had sent it away
to the cave of the Centaur Chiron, by whom Jason had been bred
up, and had now come to seek his fortune.&nbsp; He had lost his
shoe in the mud, while kindly carrying an old woman across a
river, little knowing that she was really the goddess Juno, who
had come down in that form to make trial of the kindness of men,
and who was thus made his friend for ever.&nbsp; Pelias sent for
the young stranger the next day, and asked him what he would do
if he knew who was the man fated to kill him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
should send him to fetch the Golden Fleece,&rdquo; said
Jason.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then go and fetch it,&rdquo; said Pelias.</p>
<p>Jason thereupon began building a ship, which he called Argo,
and proclaimed the intended expedition throughout Greece, thus
gathering together all the most famous heroes then living, most
of whom had, like him, been brought up by the great Centaur
Chiron.&nbsp; Hercules was one of them, and another was Theseus,
the great hero of the Ionian city of Athens, whose prowess was
almost equal to that of Hercules.&nbsp; He had caught and killed
the great white bull which Hercules had brought from Crete and
let loose, and he had also destroyed the <!-- page 53--><a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>horrid robber
Procrustes (the Stretcher), who had kept two iron bedsteads, one
long and one short.&nbsp; He put tall men into the short bed, and
cut them down to fit it, and short men into the long bed, pulling
them out till they died, until Theseus finished his life on one
of his own beds.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p53.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>Another deed of Theseus was in Crete.&nbsp; The great white
bull which Minos ought to have sacrificed had left a horrible
offspring, a monster called the Minotaur, half man and half bull,
which ate human flesh, and did horrible harm, till a clever
artificer named D&aelig;dalus made a dwelling for it called the
Labyrinth, approached by so many cross paths, winding in and out
in a maze, <!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>that everyone who entered it was sure
to lose himself; and the Minotaur could never get out, but still
they fed him there; and as Athens was subject to Crete, the
people were required to send every year a tribute of seven youths
and seven maidens for the Minotaur to devour.&nbsp; Theseus
offered himself to be one of these, telling his father that
whereas a black sail was always carried by the ship that bore
these victims to their death, he would, if he succeeded in
killing the Minotaur, as he hoped to do, hoist a white one when
coming home.&nbsp; When he reached Crete, he won the heart of
Minos&rsquo; daughter Ariadne, who gave him a skein of thread: by
unwinding this as he went he would leave a clue behind him, by
which he could find his way out of the labyrinth, after killing
the monster.&nbsp; When this was done, by his great skill and
strength, he took ship again, and Ariadne came with him; but he
grew tired of her, and left her behind in the isle of Naxos,
where Bacchus found her weeping, consoled her, and gave her a
starry crown, which may be seen in the sky on a summer
night.&nbsp; Theseus, meantime, went back to Athens, but he had
forgotten his promise about the white sail, and his poor old
father, seeing the black one, as he sat watching on the rocks,
thought that ill news was coming, fell down, and was drowned,
just as Theseus sailed safely into port.&nbsp; Theseus was a
friend of Hercules, had been with him on his journey to the land
of the Amazons, and had married one of them named Antiope.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Two more of the Argonauts were Castor and Pollux, <!-- page
55--><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>the
twin sons of Leda, queen of Sparta.&nbsp; She had also two
daughters, named Helen and Clytemnestra, and Helen was growing
into the most beautiful woman in the world.&nbsp; These children,
in the fable, had been hatched from two huge swans&rsquo; eggs;
Castor and Clytemnestra were in one egg, and Pollux and Helen in
the other.&nbsp; Castor and Pollux were the most loving of
brothers, and while Castor was famous for horsemanship, Pollux
was the best of boxers.&nbsp; They, too, had <!-- page 56--><a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>been pupils
of Chiron; so was Peleus of &AElig;gina, who had wooed Thetis,
one of the fifty Nereids, or sea-nymphs, though she changed
herself into all sorts of forms when he caught her
first&mdash;fire, water, a serpent, and a lioness; but he held
her fast through all, and at last she listened to him, and all
the gods and goddesses had come to the wedding feast.&nbsp; They
had one son, named Achilles, whom Thetis had tried to make
immortal after Ceres&rsquo; fashion, by putting him on the fire
at night; but, like Triptolemus&rsquo; mother, Peleus had cried
out and spoilt the spell.&nbsp; Then she took the boy to the
river Styx, and bathed him there, so that he became invulnerable
all over, except in the heel by which she held him.&nbsp; The
child was now in Chiron&rsquo;s cave, being fed with the marrow
of lions and bears, to make him strong and brave.</p>
<p>One more Argonaut must be mentioned, namely, the minstrel
Orpheus.&nbsp; He was the son of the muse Calliope, and was
looked on as the first of the many glorious singers of Greece,
who taught the noblest and best lessons.&nbsp; His music, when he
played on the lyre, was so sweet, that all the animals, both
fierce and gentle, came round to hear it; and not only these, but
even the trees and rocks gathered round, entranced by the
sweetness.</p>
<p>All these and more, to the number of fifty, joined Jason in
his enterprise.&nbsp; The Argo, the ship which bore them, had
fifty oars, and in the keel was a piece of wood from the great
oak of Dodona, which could <!-- page 57--><a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>speak for the
oracles.&nbsp; When all was ready, Jason stood on the poop, and
poured forth a libation from a golden cup, praying aloud to
Jupiter, to the Winds, the Days, the Nights, and to Fate to grant
them a favourable voyage.&nbsp; Old Chiron came down from his
hills to cheer them, and pray for their return; and as the oars
kept measured time, Orpheus struck his lyre in tune with their
splash in the blue waters.</p>
<p>They had many adventures.&nbsp; After passing the Hellespont,
they found in the Propontis, which we call the Sea of Marmora, an
islet called the Bears&rsquo; Hill, inhabited by giants with six
arms, whom they slew.</p>
<p>In Mysia a youth named Hylas went ashore to fetch water, but
was caught by the nymphs of the stream and taken captive.&nbsp;
Hercules, hearing his cry, went in search of him, and, as neither
returned, the Argo sailed without them.&nbsp; No more was heard
of Hylas, but Hercules went back to Argos.</p>
<p>They next visited Phineus, a wise old blind king, who was
tormented by horrid birds called Harpies, with women&rsquo;s
faces.&nbsp; These monsters always came down when he was going to
eat, devoured the food, and spoilt what they did not eat.&nbsp;
The Argonauts having among them two winged sons of Boreas (the
north wind), hunted these horrible creatures far out into the
Mediterranean.&nbsp; Phineus then told them that they would have
to pass between some floating rocks called the Symplegades, which
were always enveloped in mist, were often driven together by the
wind, and crushed <!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>whatever was between.&nbsp; He told
them to let fly a dove, and if it went through safely they might
follow.&nbsp; They did so, and the dove came out at the other
side, but with her tail clipped off as the rocks met.&nbsp;
However, on went the Argo, each hero rowing for his life, and
Juno and Pallas helping them; and, after all, they were but just
in time, and lost the ornaments at their stern!&nbsp; Fate had
decreed that, when once a ship passed through these rocks unhurt,
they should become fixed, and thus they were no longer
dangerous.&nbsp; It does not seem unlikely that this story might
have come from some report of the dangers of icebergs.&nbsp; Of
course there are none in the Black Sea, but the Greeks, who knew
little beyond their own shores, seem to have fancied that this
was open to the north into the great surrounding ocean, and the
Ph&oelig;nicians, who were much more adventurous sailors than
they, may have brought home histories of the perils they met in
the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>The Argonauts had one more encounter with Hercules&rsquo; old
foes, the birds of Stymphalis, and after this safely arrived at
Colchis, and sailed into the mouth of the river Phasis, from
which it is said the pheasant takes its name.</p>

Jason arrived at Colchis, he sent to King &AElig;etes, and asked
of him the Golden Fleece.&nbsp; To this &AElig;etes replied that
he might have it, provided he could yoke the two brazen-footed
bulls with flaming breath, which had been a present from Vulcan,
and with them plough a piece of land, and sow it with the
dragon&rsquo;s teeth.&nbsp; Pallas had given &AElig;etes half the
teeth of the dragon of Thebes, which had been slain by
Cadmus.</p>
<p>The task seemed beyond his reach, till Medea, the wicked
witch, daughter of &AElig;etes, promised to help him, on
condition that he would marry her, and take her to Greece.&nbsp;
When Jason had sworn to do so, Medea gave him an ointment with
which to rub himself, also his shield and spear.&nbsp; For a
whole day afterwards neither sword nor fire should hurt him, and
he would thus be able to master the bulls.&nbsp; So he found it;
he made them draw the plough, and then he sowed the teeth, which
came up, like those sown by Cadmus, as armed men, who began to
attack him; but, as Medea had bidden him, he threw a stone among
them, and they began to fight <!-- page 60--><a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>with one
another, so that he could easily kill the few who spared each
other.</p>
<p>Still &AElig;etes refused to give him the fleece, and was
about to set fire to the Argo, and kill the crew; but Medea
warned Jason in time, and led him to the spot where it was nailed
against a tree.&nbsp; Orpheus lulled the guardian dragon to sleep
with his lyre, while Jason took down the fleece; and Medea joined
them, carrying in her arms her little brother, whom she had
snatched from his bed with a cruel purpose, for when her father
took alarm and gave chase, she cut the poor child to pieces, and
strewed his limbs on the stream of the Phasis, so that, while her
father waited to collect them, the Argo had time to sail
away.</p>

</a>It did not return by the same route, but went to the north,
and came to the isle of the goddess Circe, who purified Jason and
Medea from the blood of the poor boy.&nbsp; Then they came to the
isle of the Sirens, creatures like fair maidens, who stood on the
shore singing so sweetly that no sailor could resist the charm;
but the moment any man reached the shore, they strangled him and
sucked his blood.&nbsp; Warned by Medea, Orpheus played and sang
so grandly as to drown their fatal song, and the Argo came out
into the <!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>Mediterranean somewhere near
Trinacria, the three-cornered island now called Sicily, where
they had to pass between two lofty cliffs.&nbsp; In a cave under
one of these lived a monster called Scylla, with twelve limbs and
six long necks, with a dog&rsquo;s head to each, ready each to
seize a man out of every ship that passed; but it was safer to
keep on her side than to go to the other cliff, for there a
water-witch named Charybdis lived in a whirlpool, and was sure to
suck the whole ship in, and swallow it up.&nbsp; However, for her
husband Peleus&rsquo; sake, Thetis and her sister Nereids came
and guided the Argo safely through.</p>
<p>When the crew returned to Iolcus, they had only been absent
four months; and Jason gave the fleece to his uncle Pelias, and
dedicated the Argo to Neptune.&nbsp; He found his father
&AElig;son grown very old, but Medea undertook to restore him to
youth.&nbsp; She went forth by moonlight, gathered a number of
herbs, and then, putting them in a caldron, she cut old
&AElig;son into pieces, threw them in, and boiled them all
night.&nbsp; In the morning &AElig;son appeared as a lively
black-haired young man, no older than his son.&nbsp;
Pelias&rsquo; daughters came and begged her to teach them the
same spell.&nbsp; She feigned to do so, but she did not tell them
the true herbs, and thus the poor maidens only slew their father,
and did not bring him to life again.&nbsp; The son of Pelias
drove the treacherous Medea and her husband from Iolcus, and they
went to Corinth, where they lived ten years, until Jason grew
weary of Medea, and put her away, in order to marry Creusa, the
king&rsquo;s daughter.&nbsp; In her <!-- page 62--><a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>rage, Medea
sent the bride the fatal gift of a poisoned robe, then she killed
her own children, and flew away, in a chariot drawn by winged
serpents, to the east, where she became the mother of a son named
Medus, from whom the nation of Medes was descended.&nbsp; As to
Jason, he had fallen asleep at noon one hot day under the shade
of the Argo, where it was drawn up on the sand by Neptune&rsquo;s
temple, when a bit of wood broke off from the prow, fell on his
head, and killed him.</p>

<p>Of the other Argonauts, Orpheus went to Thessaly, and there
taught and softened the people much by his <!-- page 63--><a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>music.&nbsp;
He married a fair maiden named Eurydice, with whom he lived
happily and peacefully, till she was bitten by a venomous serpent
and died.&nbsp; Orpheus was so wretched that he set forth to try
to bring her back from Tartarus.&nbsp; He went with nothing but
his lyre, and his music was so sweet that Cerberus stood
listening, and let him pass, and all the torments of the Danaids,
Sisyphus and all the rest, ceased while he was playing.&nbsp; His
song even brought tears into Pluto&rsquo;s eyes, and Proserpine,
who guarded the female dead, gave him leave to take back Eurydice
to the light of day, provided he did not once look back as he led
her out of Tartarus.</p>
<p>Orpheus had to walk first, and, as he went up the long, dark
cavern, with Eurydice behind him, he carefully obeyed, till, just
as he was reaching the upper air, he unhappily forgot, and turned
his head to see whether she were following.&nbsp; He just saw her
stretch out her hands to him, and then she was drawn back, and
vanished from his sight.&nbsp; The gates were closed, and he had
lost her again.&nbsp; After this he wandered sadly about, all his
songs turned to woe, until at last the Bacchanal women, in fury
at his despising the foul rites of their god, tore him limb from
limb.&nbsp; The Muses collected his remains, and gave them
funeral rites, and Jupiter placed his lyre in the skies, where
you may know it by one of the brightest of all our stars.</p>
<p>Hercules also made another visit to the realms below.&nbsp;
Admetus, one of the &AElig;olian kings, had obtained from Apollo
that, when the time came for him to die, his life <!-- page
64--><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>should be prolonged if anyone would submit to death in
his turn.&nbsp; The call came while Admetus was still young, and
he besought his old father, and then his mother, to die in his
stead; but they would not, and it was his fair young wife
Alcestis who gave her life for his.&nbsp; Just as she was laid in
the tomb, Hercules came to visit Admetus, and, on hearing what
had happened, he went down to the kingdom of Pluto and brought
her back.&nbsp; Or some say he sat by her tomb, and wrestled with
Death when he came to seize her.</p>
<p>But, strong as he was, Hercules had in time to meet death
himself.&nbsp; He had married a nymph named Deianira, and was
taking her home, when he came to a river where a Centaur named
Nessus lived, and gained his bread by carrying travellers over on
his back.&nbsp; Hercules paid him the price for carrying Deianira
over, while he himself crossed on foot; but as soon as the river
was between them, the faithless Centaur began to gallop away with
the lady.&nbsp; Hercules sent an arrow after him, which brought
him to the ground, and as he was dying he prepared his revenge,
by telling Deianira that his blood was enchanted with love for
her, and that if ever she found her husband&rsquo;s affection
failing her, she had only to make him put on a garment anointed
with it, and his heart would return to her: he knew full well
that his blood was full of the poison of the Hydra, but poor
Deianira believed him, and had saved some of the blood before
Hercules came up.</p>
<p>Several years after, Hercules made prisoner a maiden <!-- page
65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>named
Iole, in Lydia, after gaining a great victory.&nbsp; Landing in
the island of Eub&oelig;a, he was going to make a great sacrifice
to Jupiter, and sent home to Deianira for a festal garment to
wear at it.&nbsp; She was afraid he was falling in love with
Iole, and steeped the garment in the preparation she had made
from Nessus&rsquo; blood.&nbsp; No sooner did Hercules put it on,
than his veins were filled with agony, which nothing could
assuage.&nbsp; He tried to tear off the robe, but the skin and
flesh came with it, and his blood was poisoned beyond
relief.&nbsp; He sailed home, and when Deianira saw the state he
was in she hung herself for grief, while he charged Hylas, his
eldest son, to take care of Iole, and marry her as soon as he
grew up.&nbsp; Then, unable to bear the pain any longer, and
knowing that by his twelve tasks he had earned the prize of
endless life, he went to Mount &OElig;ta, crying aloud with the
pain, so that the rocks rang again with the sound.&nbsp; He gave
his quiver of arrows to his friend Philoctetes, charging him to
collect his ashes and bury them, but never to make known the
spot; and then he tore up, with his mighty strength, trees by the
roots enough to form a funeral pile, lay down on it, and called
on his friend to set fire to it; but no one could bear to do so,
till a shepherd consented to thrust in a torch.&nbsp; Then
thunder was heard, a cloud came down, and he was borne away to
Olympus, while Philoctetes collected and buried the ashes.</p>
<p>His young sons were banished by Eurystheus, and were taken by
his old friend Iolaus to seek shelter in various <!-- page
66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>cities, but only the Athenians were brave enough to let
them remain.&nbsp; Theseus had been driven away and banished from
Athens; but the citizens sheltered the sons of the hero, and,
when Eurystheus pursued them, a battle was fought on the isthmus
of Corinth, in which the old enemy of Hercules was killed by
Iolaus, with all his sons.&nbsp; Then the Heraclieds (sons of
Hercules) were going to fight their way back to Argos, but an
army met them at the isthmus, and was going to give them battle,
when Hylas proposed that he should fight with a single champion
chosen on the other side.&nbsp; If he gained, he was to be
restored to the kingdom of Perseus; if not, there was to be a
truce for a hundred years.&nbsp; Hylas had not the strength of
his father; he was slain, and his brothers had to retreat and
bide their time.</p>
<p>Argos came into the power of Agamemnon, who had married
Clytemnestra, the sister of Castor and Pollux, while his brother
Menelaus married the beautiful Helen.&nbsp; All the Greek heroes
had been suitors for Helen, the fairest woman living, and they
all swore to one another that, choose she whom she might, they
would all stand by him, and punish anyone who might try to steal
her from him.&nbsp; Her choice fell on Menelaus, and soon after
her wedding her brother Castor was slain, and though Pollux was
immortal, he could not bear to live without his brother, and
prayed to share his death; upon which Jupiter made them both
stars, the bright ones called Gemini, or the Twins, and Menelaus
reigned with Helen at Sparta, as Agamemnon did at
Mycen&aelig;.</p>
<p><!-- page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>These two were sons of Atreus, and were descended from
Tantalus, once a favourite of the gods, who used to come down and
feast with him, until once he took his son Pelops and dressed him
for their meal.&nbsp; Jupiter found it out, collected the limbs,
and restored the boy to life; but Ceres had been so distracted
with grief about her daughter, that she had eaten one shoulder,
and Jupiter gave him an ivory one instead.&nbsp; Tantalus was
sent to Tartarus, where his punishment was to pine with hunger
and thirst, with a feast before him, where he neither could touch
the food nor the drink, because there was a rock hung over his
head threatening to crush him.&nbsp; Pelops was a wonderful
charioteer, and won his bride in the chariot race, having bribed
the charioteer of his rival to leave out the linchpins of his
wheels.&nbsp; Afterwards, when the charioteer asked a reward,
Pelops threw him into the sea; and this was the second crime that
brought a doom on the race.&nbsp; Pelops gave his name to the
whole peninsula now called the Morea, or mulberry-leaf, but which
was all through ancient times known as the Peloponnesus, or Isle
of Pelops.&nbsp; He reigned at Elis, and after his death his sons
Atreus and Thyestes struggled for the rule, but both were
horribly wicked men, and Atreus was said to have killed two sons
of Thyestes, and served them up to him at a feast.&nbsp; There
was, therefore, a heavy curse on the whole family, both on
&AElig;gisthus, son of Thyestes, and on his cousins Agamemnon and
Menelaus, the Atrid&aelig;, or sons of Atreus.</p>

and goddesses were merrily feasting when Ate, the goddess of
strife, desirous of making mischief, threw down among them a
golden apple, engraven with the words, &ldquo;This apple to the
Fair.&rdquo;&nbsp; The three goddesses, Juno, Pallas, and Venus,
each thought it meant for her&mdash;one having the beauty of
dignity, the other the beauty of wisdom, and the third the beauty
of grace and fairness.&nbsp; They would not accept the award of
any of the gods, lest they should not be impartial; but they
declared that no one should decide between them but Paris, a
shepherd, though a king&rsquo;s son, who was keeping his flocks
on Mount Ida.</p>
<p>Each goddess tried to allure him to choose her by
promises.&nbsp; Juno offered him a mighty throne; Pallas promised
to make him the wisest of men; Venus declared that she would give
him the fairest woman on earth for his wife for ten
years&mdash;she could assure him of no more.&nbsp; And it was
Venus to whom Paris assigned the golden apple of discord, thus
bitterly offending Juno and Pallas, who became the enemies of his
nation.</p>

69</span>His nation was the Trojan, who dwelt on the east coast
of the &AElig;gean Sea, and were of the Pelasgic race.&nbsp;
Their chief city was Troy, with the citadel Ilium, lying near the
banks of the rivers Simois and Scamander, between the sea shore
and the wooded mount of Ida, in the north-east of the peninsula
we call Asia Minor.&nbsp; The story went that the walls had been
built by Neptune and Apollo, the last of whom had brought the
stones to their place by the music of his lyre; but the king who
<!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>was then reigning had refused to pay them, and had thus
made them also his foes.&nbsp; But within the citadel was an
image of Pallas, three ells long, with a spear in one hand and a
distaff in the other, which was called the Palladium.&nbsp; It
was said to have been given by Jupiter to Ilus, the first founder
of the city; and as long as it was within the walls, the place
could never be taken.</p>
<p>The present king was Priam, and his wife was Hecuba.&nbsp;
They had nineteen children, and lived in a palace built round a
court, with an altar in the middle, their sons having houses
likewise opening into the court.&nbsp; Paris, who was worthless
and pleasure-loving, was the eldest son; Hector, a very noble
person, was the second.&nbsp; After Paris had given judgment in
her favour, Venus directed him to build a ship, and go to visit
the Greek kings.&nbsp; He was kindly entertained everywhere, and
especially at Sparta; and here it was that Venus fulfilled her
promise, by helping him to steal away Helen, the fairest of
women, while her husband Menelaus was gone to Crete.</p>
<p>As soon as Menelaus found out how his hospitality had been
misused, he called upon all the Greek heroes to remember their
oath, and help him to recover his wife, and take vengeance on
Paris.&nbsp; Everyone replied to the call; but the wise Ulysses,
grandson of Sisyphus, and king of the little isle of Ithaca,
could not bear to leave his home, or his fair young wife
Penelope, for a war which he knew would be long and terrible, so
he feigned to be mad, and began furiously ploughing the <!-- page
71--><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>sea
shore with a yoke of oxen.&nbsp; However, the next cleverest
hero, Palamedes, to prove him, placed his infant son Telemachus
full in the way of the plough, and when Ulysses turned it aside
from the child, they declared that his madness was only
pretended, and he was forced to go with them.</p>
<p>The Nereid Thetis knew that if her brave and beautiful son
Achilles went to Troy, he would die there; so she dressed him as
a maiden, and placed him at the court of the king of Scyros,
where he stayed for love of one of the king&rsquo;s
daughters.&nbsp; But the Greeks had a man named Calchas, who was
an augur&mdash;that is, he could tell what was going to happen by
the flight of birds, by the clouds, and by the inwards of
sacrificed animals.&nbsp; Calchas told the Greeks that Troy would
never be taken unless Achilles went with them.&nbsp; So Ulysses,
guessing where the youth was, disguised himself as a merchant,
and went with his wares to the palace of Scyros.&nbsp; All the
maidens came forth to look at them, and while most were busy with
the jewels and robes, one, tall and golden-haired, seemed to care
for nothing but a bright sword, holding it with a strong, firm
hand.&nbsp; Then Ulysses knew he had found Achilles, and told him
of the famous war that was beginning, and the youth threw off his
maiden&rsquo;s garb, put on his armour, and went eagerly with
them; but before he went he married the fair Deidamia, and left
her to wait for him at Scyros, where she had a son named
Pyrrhus.</p>
<p>Indeed the Greeks were whole years gathering their <!-- page
72--><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>forces, and when they did all meet at last, with their
ships and men, Agamemnon, king of Mycen&aelig;, Menelaus&rsquo;
brother, took the lead of them all.&nbsp; As they were
sacrificing to Jupiter, a snake glided up a tree, where there was
a sparrow&rsquo;s nest, and ate up all the eight young ones, and
then the mother bird.&nbsp; On seeing this, Calchas foretold that
the war would last nine years, and after the ninth Troy would be
taken.</p>
<p>However, they sailed on, till at Aulis they were stopped by
foul winds for many days, and Calchas told them it was because of
Agamemnon&rsquo;s broken vow.&nbsp; He had sworn, one year, to
sacrifice to Diana the fairest thing that was born in his house
or lands.&nbsp; The fairest thing that was born was his little
daughter Iphigenia; but he could not bear to sacrifice her, and
so had tried offering his choicest kid.&nbsp; Now Diana sent
these winds to punish him, and the other kings required him to
give up his child.&nbsp; So a message was sent to her mother,
Clytemnestra, to send her, on pretence that she was to be married
to Achilles, and when she came to Aulis she found that it was
only to be offered up.&nbsp; However, she resigned herself
bravely, and was ready to die for her father and the cause; but
just as Agamemnon had his sword ready, and had covered her face
that he might not see her pleading eyes as he was slaying her,
Diana took pity, darted down in a cloud, and in the place of the
maiden a white hind lay on the altar to be offered.&nbsp;
Iphigenia was really carried off to serve as priestess at
Diana&rsquo;s temple at Tauris, but it was long before it was
<!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>known what had become of her, and Clytemnestra never
forgave Agamemnon for what he had intended to do.</p>
<p>At the isle of Tenedos the Greeks had to leave behind
Philoctetes, the friend of Hercules, who had his quiver of
poisoned arrows, because the poor man had a wound in his heel,
which was in such a dreadful state that no one could bear to come
near him.&nbsp; One story was that he was bitten by a
water-snake, another that when he was just setting off he had
been over-persuaded to show where he had buried the ashes of
Hercules.&nbsp; He did not say one word, but stamped with his
foot on the place, and an arrow fell out at the moment and
pierced his heel.&nbsp; At any rate, he and the arrows were left
behind, while the Greeks reached the coast of Troy.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The augurs had declared that the first man who touched the
shore would be the first to be killed.&nbsp; Achilles threw his
shield before him, and leaped out of the ship upon that; but
Protesilaus leaped without so <!-- page 74--><a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>doing, and
was slain almost instantly by the Trojans.&nbsp; When his wife
Laodamia heard of his death, she grieved and pined so piteously
that his spirit could not rest, and Mercury gave him leave to
come back and spend three hours with her on earth.&nbsp; He came,
but when she tried to embrace him she found that he was only thin
air, which could not be grasped, and when the time was over he
vanished from her sight.&nbsp; Then Laodamia made an image of
him, and treated it as a god; and when her father forbade her to
do this, she leaped into the fire, and thus perished.</p>
<p>The chief of the Greeks were Agamemnon, king of Mycen&aelig;,
his brother Menelaus of Sparta, and Achilles of &AElig;gina,
whose men were called Myrmidons, and said to be descended from
ants.&nbsp; His friend, to whom he was devoted, was called
Patroclus.&nbsp; He was the most perfect warrior in the army, but
Diomed the &AElig;tolian came near him in daring, and Ajax of
Salamis, son of Telamon, was the biggest and strongest man.&nbsp;
His brother Teucer used to stand behind his shield and aim arrows
at the Trojans.&nbsp; There was another Ajax, from Locria, called
after his father Oileus.&nbsp; The oldest man in the camp was
Nestor, king of Pylos, who had been among the Argonauts, and had
been a friend of Hercules, and was much looked up to.&nbsp; The
wisest men were Ulysses of Ithaca, and Palamedes, who is said to
have invented the game of chess to amuse the warriors in the
camp; but Ulysses never forgave Palamedes for his trick on the
shore at Ithaca, and managed <!-- page 75--><a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>to make him
be suspected of secret dealings with the Trojans, and put to
death.&nbsp; Each of these brought a band of fighting men, and
they had their ships, which were not much more than large boats,
drawn up high and dry on the shore behind the camp.&nbsp; They
fought with swords and spears, which latter were thrown with the
hand.&nbsp; Some had bows and arrows, and the chiefs generally
went to battle in a chariot, an open car drawn by two horses, and
driven by some trusty friend, who held the horses while the chief
stood up and launched spear after spear among the enemy.&nbsp;
There was no notion of mercy to the fallen; prisoners were seldom
made, and if a man was once down, unless his friends could save
him, he was sure to be killed.</p>
<p>During the first eight years of the war we do not hear much of
the Greeks.&nbsp; They seem to have been taking and wasting the
cities belonging to the Trojans all round the country.&nbsp; The
home of Andromache, Hector&rsquo;s good and loving wife, was
destroyed, and her parents and brothers killed; and Priam&rsquo;s
cousin &AElig;neas was also driven in from Mount Ida, with his
old father Anchises, and wife and little son.&nbsp; In the ninth
year of the war the Greeks drew up their forces round the walls
of Troy itself, their last exploit having been the taking of the
city of Chrys&aelig;, where they had gained a great deal of
plunder.&nbsp; All captives were then made slaves, and in the
division of the spoil a maiden named Briseis was given to
Achilles, while Agamemnon took one called Chryseis, the daughter
of Chryses, priest of Apollo.</p>

<h2>CHAP. IX.&mdash;THE SIEGE OF TROY.</h2>
<p>
<img class='dc' alt='W' title='W' src='images/dcw.jpg' />e have
come to the part of this siege which is told us in the
<i>Iliad</i>, the oldest poem we know, except the Psalms, and one
of the very finest.&nbsp; It begins by telling how Chryses prayed
to Apollo to help him to get back his daughter, and Apollo sent a
plague upon the Greeks in their camp.&nbsp; Calchas told them it
was because of Chryseis, and they forced Agamemnon to give her
safely back to her father.&nbsp; His pride, however, was hurt,
and he said he must have Briseis in her stead, and sent and took
her from Achilles.&nbsp; In his wrath Achilles declared he would
not fight any more for the Greeks, and his mother Thetis begged
Jupiter to withdraw his aid from them likewise, that they might
feel the difference.</p>
<p>The Trojans went out to attack them, and when they were drawn
up in battle array, old Priam made Helen come and sit by him on
the battlements over the gateway, to tell him who all the chiefs
were.&nbsp; It was proposed that, instead of causing the death of
numbers who had nothing to do with the quarrel, Menelaus and <!--
page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>Paris should fight hand-to-hand for Helen; and they
began; but as soon as Venus saw that her favourite Paris was in
danger, she came in a cloud, snatched him away, and set him down
in Helen&rsquo;s chamber, where his brother Hector found him
reclining at his ease, on coming to upbraid him for keeping out
of the battle, where so many better men than he were dying for
his crime.&nbsp; Very different were Hector&rsquo;s ways.&nbsp;
He parted most tenderly with his wife Andromache, and his little
son Astyanax, who was so young that he clung crying to his nurse,
afraid of his father&rsquo;s tall helmet and horsehair
crest.&nbsp; Hector took the helmet off before he lifted the
little one in his arms and prayed to the gods for him.</p>
<p>Each day the Trojans gained, though one day Jupiter forbade
any of the gods or goddesses to interfere, and on another he let
them all go down and fight for their own parties.&nbsp; He was
himself impartial; but one day Juno managed to borrow
Venus&rsquo; girdle, which made her so charming that nothing
could resist her, and she lulled him to sleep.&nbsp; During that
time the Greeks prevailed again, but this only lasted till
Jupiter awoke, and then the Trojans gained great success.&nbsp;
All the Greek heroes were disabled one after another, and Hector
and his men broke through the rampart they had made round their
camp, and were about to burn the ships, when Patroclus, grieved
at finding all his friends wounded, came to Achilles with an
entreaty that he might be allowed to send out the Myrmidons, and
try to save the ships.&nbsp; Achilles consented, and dressed <!--
page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>Patroclus in his own armour.&nbsp; Then all gave way
before the fresh Myrmidons led by Patroclus, and the Trojans were
chased back to their walls; but as Hector made a last stand
before the gates, Apollo, who loved Troy because he had built the
walls, caused a sunbeam to strike on Patroclus and make him
faint, so that Hector easily struck him down and killed
him.&nbsp; Then there was a desperate fight over his body.&nbsp;
The Trojans did get the armour off it, but the Greeks saved the
corpse, and had almost reached the rampart, when the Trojans came
thicker and more furiously on them, and were almost bursting in,
when Achilles, hearing the noise, came out, and, standing on the
rampart just as he was, all unarmed, gave a terrible thundering
shout, at which the Trojans were filled with dismay, and fled
back in confusion, while the corpse of Patroclus was borne into
the tent, where Achilles mourned over it, with many tears and
vows of vengeance against Hector.</p>

</a>His mother Thetis came from the sea and wept with him, and
thence she went to Vulcan, from whom she obtained another
beautiful suit of armour, with a wondrous shield, representing
Greek life in every phase of war or peace; and in this Achilles
went forth again to <!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>the battle.&nbsp; He drove the
Trojans before his irresistible might, came up with Hector,
chased him round and round the walls of Troy, and at length came
up with him and slew him.&nbsp; Then, when Patroclus had been
laid on a costly funeral pile, Achilles dragged Hector&rsquo;s
body at the back of his chariot three times round it.&nbsp;
Further, in honour of his friend, he had games of racing in
chariots and on foot, wrestling, boxing, throwing heavy stones,
and splendidly rewarded those who excelled with metal tripods,
weapons, and robes.</p>
<p>But when poor old Priam, grieving that his son&rsquo;s corpse
should lie unburied, thus hindering his shade from being at rest,
came forth at night, in disguise, to beg it from Achilles, the
hero received the old man most kindly, wept at the thought of his
own old father Peleus, fed and warmed him, and sent home the body
of Hector most honourably.</p>
<p>Here ends the <i>Iliad</i>.&nbsp; It is from other poems that
the rest of the history is taken, and we know that Achilles
performed many more great exploits, until Paris was aided by
Apollo to shoot an arrow into the heel which alone could be
wounded, and thus the hero died.&nbsp; There was another great
fight over his body, but Ajax and Ulysses rescued it at last;
Ajax bore it to the ships, and Ulysses kept back the
Trojans.&nbsp; Thetis and all the Nereids and all the Muses came
to mourn over him; and when he was burnt in the funeral pile she
bore away his spirit to the white island, while the Greeks raised
a huge mound in his honour.&nbsp; She <!-- page 80--><a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>promised his
armour to the Greek who had done most to rescue his corpse.&nbsp;
The question lay between Ajax and Ulysses, and Trojan captives
being appointed as judges, gave sentence in favour of
Ulysses.&nbsp; Ajax was so grieved that he had a fit of frenzy,
fancied the cattle were the Greeks who slighted him, killed whole
flocks in his rage, and, when he saw what he had done, fell on
his own sword and died.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Having lost these great champions, the Greeks resolved to
fetch Achilles&rsquo; young son Pyrrhus to the camp, and also to
get again those arrows of Hercules which Philoctetes had with
him.&nbsp; Ulysses and Pyrrhus were accordingly sent to fetch him
from his lonely island.&nbsp; They found him howling with pain,
but he would not hear of coming away with them.&nbsp; So Ulysses
stole his quiver while he was asleep, but when he awoke and
missed it his lamentations so moved young Pyrrhus that he gave
them back; and this so touched the heart of Philoctetes that he
consented to return to the camp.&nbsp; <!-- page 81--><a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>There
Machaon, the physician of the Greeks, healed his foot, and he
soon after shot Paris with one of the arrows.</p>
<p>Instead of now giving up Helen, Deiphobus and Helenus, the two
next brothers, quarrelled as to which should marry her, and when
she was given to Deiphobus, Helenus was so angry that he went out
and wandered in the forests of Mount Ida, where he was made
prisoner by Ulysses, who contrived to find out from him that Troy
could never be taken while it had the Palladium within it.&nbsp;
Accordingly, Ulysses and Diomed set out, and, climbing over the
wall by night, stole the wondrous image.&nbsp; While the Trojans
were dismayed at the loss, the Greeks seemed to have changed
their minds.&nbsp; They took ship and went away, and all the
surviving Trojans, relieved from their siege, rushed down to the
shore, where all they found was a monstrous wooden horse.&nbsp;
While they were looking at it in wonder, a Greek came out of the
rocks, and told them that his name was Sinon, and that he had
been cruelly left behind by the Greeks, who had grown weary of
the siege and gone home, but that if the wonderful horse were
once taken into Troy it would serve as another Palladium.&nbsp;
The priest of Neptune, Laoc&ouml;on, did not believe the story,
and declared that Sinon was a spy; but he was cut short in his
remonstrance by two huge serpents, which glided out of the sea
and devoured him and his two sons.&nbsp; Cassandra, too, a
daughter of Priam, who had the gift of prophecy, but was fated
never to be believed, shrieked with <!-- page 82--><a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>despair when
she saw the Trojans harnessing themselves to the horse to drag it
into Troy, but nobody heeded her, and there was a great feast to
dedicate it to Pallas.&nbsp; Helen perhaps guessed or knew what
it meant, for at dark she walked round it, and called the names
of Ulysses, and many other Greeks, in the voices of Penelope and
the other wives at home.</p>

</a>For indeed the horse was full of Greeks; and at dark Sinon
lighted a beacon as a signal to the rest, who were only waiting
behind the little isle of Tenedos.&nbsp; Then he let the others
out of the horse, and slaughter and fire reigned throughout
Troy.&nbsp; Menelaus slew Deiphobus as he tried to rise from bed,
and carried Helen down to his ship.&nbsp; Poor old Priam tried to
put on his armour and defend Hecuba and his daughters, but
Pyrrhus killed him at the altar in his palace-court; and
&AElig;neas, after <!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 83</span>seeing this, and that all was lost,
hurried back to his own house, took his father Anchises on his
back, and his little son Iulus in one hand, his household gods in
the other, and, with his wife Creusa following, tried to escape
from the burning city with his own troop of warriors.&nbsp; All
succeeded except poor Creusa, who was lost in the throng of
terrified fugitives, and was never found again; but &AElig;neas
found ships on the coast, and sailed safely away to Italy.</p>
<p>All the rest of the Trojans were killed or made slaves.&nbsp;
Ulysses killed Hector&rsquo;s poor little son, and Andromache
became slave to young Pyrrhus.&nbsp; Cassandra clung to
Pallas&rsquo; statue, and Ajax Oileus, trying to drag her away,
moved the statue itself&mdash;such an act of sacrilege that the
Greeks had nearly stoned him on the spot&mdash;and Cassandra was
given to Agamemnon.&nbsp; Polyxena, the youngest sister, was
sacrificed on the tomb of Achilles, and poor old Hecuba went mad
with grief.</p>

<img class='dc' alt='T' title='T' src='images/dct.jpg' />he
overthrow of the temples at Troy was heavily visited on the
Greeks by the gods, and the disasters that befel Ulysses are the
subject of another grand Greek poem called the <i>Odyssey</i>,
from his right Greek name Odysseus.&nbsp; He was the special
favourite of Pallas Athene, but she could not save him from many
dangers.&nbsp; He had twelve ships, with which he set out to
return to Ithaca; but as he was doubling Cape Malea, one of the
rugged points of the Peloponnesus, a great storm caught him, and
drove him nine days westward, till he came to an island, where he
sent three men to explore, but they did not return, and he found
that this was the land of the lotus-eaters, a people who always
lie about in a dreamy state of repose, and that to taste the food
drives away all remembrance of home and friends.&nbsp; He was
obliged to drag his men away by force, and bind them to the
benches.&nbsp; The lotus bean, or jujube, is really eaten in
Africa, but not with these effects.</p>
<p>Next they came to another island, where there was a bay with
rocks around, with goats leaping on them.&nbsp; <!-- page 85--><a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>Here Ulysses
left eleven ships, and sailed with one to explore the little
islet opposite.&nbsp; Landing with his men, he entered an
enormous cavern, well stored with bowls of milk and cream, and
with rows of cheeses standing on the ledges of rock.&nbsp; While
the Greeks were regaling themselves, a noise was heard, and great
flocks of sheep and goats came bleating in.&nbsp; Behind them
came a giant, with a fir tree for a staff, and only one eye in
the middle of his forehead.&nbsp; He was Polyphemus, one of the
Cyclops, sons of Neptune, and workmen of Vulcan.&nbsp; He asked
fiercely who the strangers were, and Ulysses told him that they
were shipwrecked sailors, imploring him for hospitality in the
name of the gods.&nbsp; Polyphemus laughed at this, saying he was
stronger than the gods, and did not care for them; and, dashing
two unhappy Greeks on the floor, he ate them up at once; after
which he closed up the front of the cave with a monstrous rock,
penned up the kids and lambs, and began to milk his goats, drank
up a great quantity of milk, and fell asleep on the ground.&nbsp;
Ulysses thought of killing him at once, but recollected that the
stone at the mouth of the cave would keep him captive if the
giant&rsquo;s strength did not move it, and abstained.&nbsp; In
the morning the Cyclops let out his flocks, and then shut the
Greeks in with the stone; but he left his staff behind, and
Ulysses hardened the top of this in the fire.&nbsp; A skin of
wine had been brought from the ships, and when Polyphemus came
home in the evening, and had devoured two more Greeks, Ulysses
offered it to him.&nbsp; <!-- page 86--><a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>It was the
first wine he had tasted, and he was in raptures with it, asking
his guest&rsquo;s name as he pledged him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No-man,&rdquo; replied Ulysses, begging again for
mercy.&nbsp; &ldquo;This will I grant,&rdquo; said the Cyclops,
&ldquo;in return for thy gift.&nbsp; No-man shall be the last
whom I devour.&rdquo;&nbsp; He drank up the whole skin of wine,
and went to sleep.&nbsp; Then Ulysses and four of his companions
seized the staff, and forced its sharpened top into the
Cyclops&rsquo; single eye, so that he awoke blind, and roaring
with pain so loud that all the other Cyclops awoke, and came
calling to know who had hurt him.&nbsp; &ldquo;No-man,&rdquo;
shouted back Polyphemus; and they, thinking it was only some
sudden illness, went back to their caves.&nbsp; Meanwhile,
Ulysses was fastening the remaining Greeks under the bellies of
the sheep and goats, the wool and hair hanging over them.&nbsp;
He himself clung on under the largest goat, the master of the
herd.&nbsp; When morning came, bleatings of the herds caused the
blind giant to rouse himself to roll back the stone from the
entrance.&nbsp; He laid his hand on each beast&rsquo;s back, that
his guests might not ride out on them, but he did not feel
beneath, though he kept back Ulysses&rsquo; goat for a moment
caressing it, and saying, &ldquo;My pretty goat, thou seest me,
but I cannot see thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as Ulysses was safe on board ship, and had thrust out
from land, he called back his real name to the giant, whom he saw
sitting on the stone outside his cave.&nbsp; Polyphemus and the
other Cyclops returned by hurling rocks at the ship, but none
touched it, and <!-- page 87--><a name="page87"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 87</span>Ulysses reached his fleet
safely.&nbsp; This adventure, however, had made Neptune his
bitter foe, and how could he sail on Neptune&rsquo;s realm?</p>
<p>However, he next came to the Isle of the Winds, which floated
about in the ocean, and was surrounded by a brazen wall.&nbsp;
Here dwelt &AElig;olus, with his wife and sons and daughters, and
Ulysses stayed with him a whole month.&nbsp; At the end of it,
&AElig;olus gave Ulysses enough of each wind, tied up in separate
bags, to take him safely home; but his crew fancied there was
treasure in them, and while he was asleep opened all the bags at
once, and the winds bursting out tossed all the ships, and then
carried them back to the island, where &AElig;olus declared that
Ulysses must be a wretch forsaken of the gods, and would give him
no more.</p>
<p>Six days later the fleet came to another cannibal island, that
of the L&aelig;strygonians, where the crews of all the ships,
except that of the king himself, were caught and eaten up, and he
alone escaped, and, still proceeding westward, came to another
isle, belonging to Circe, the witch goddess, daughter to
Helios.&nbsp; The comrades of Ulysses, whom he had sent to
explore, did not return, and he was himself landing in search of
them, when Mercury appeared to him, and warned him that, if he
tasted of the bowl she would offer him, he would, like his
friends, be changed by her into a hog, unless he fortified
himself with the plant named moly&mdash;a white-flowered, starry
sort of garlic, which Mercury gave him.&nbsp; Ulysses then made
his way through a wood <!-- page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>to the hall where Circe sat, waited
on by four nymphs.&nbsp; She received him courteously, offered
him her cup, and so soon as he had drunk of it she struck him
with her wand, and bade him go grunt with his fellows; but as,
thanks to the moly, he stood unchanged before her, he drew his
sword and made her swear to do him no hurt, and to restore his
companions to their proper form.&nbsp; They then made friends,
and he stayed with her a whole year.&nbsp; She told him that he
was fated not to return home till he had first visited the
borders of the world of Pluto, and consulted Tiresias, the blind
prophet.&nbsp; She told him what to do, and he went on beyond the
Mediterranean into the outer ocean, to the land of gloom, where
Helios, the sun, does not shine.&nbsp; Here Ulysses dug a pit,
into which he poured water, wine, and the blood of a great black
ram, and there flocked up to him crowds of shades, eager to drink
of it, and to converse with him.&nbsp; All his own friends were
there&mdash;Achilles, Ajax, and, to his surprise,
Agamemnon&mdash;all very melancholy, and mourning for the realms
of day.&nbsp; His mother, who had died of grief for his absence,
came and blessed him; and Tiresias warned him of Neptune&rsquo;s
anger, and of his other dangers, ere he should return to
Ithaca.&nbsp; Terror at the ghastly troop overcame him at last,
and he fled and embarked again, saw Circe once more, and found
himself in the sea by which the Argo had returned.&nbsp; The
Sirens&rsquo; Isle was near, and, to prevent the perils of their
song, Ulysses stopped the ears of all his crew with wax, and
though he left his <!-- page 89--><a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>own open, bade them lash him to the
mast, and not heed all his cries and struggles to be
loosed.&nbsp; Thus he was the only person who ever heard the
Sirens&rsquo; song and lived.&nbsp; Scylla and Charybdis came
next, and, being warned by Pallas, he thought it better to lose
six than all, and so went nearest to the monster, whose six
mouths at once fell on six of the crew, and tore them away.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>The isle of Trinacria was pasture for the 360 cattle of
Helios, and both Tiresias and Circe had warned Ulysses that they
must not be touched.&nbsp; He would fain have passed it by, but
his crew insisted on landing for the night, making oath not to
touch the herds.&nbsp; At dawn such a wind arose that they could
not put to <!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 90</span>sea for a month, and after eating up
the stores, and living on birds and fish, they took some of the
oxen when Ulysses was asleep, vowing to build a temple to Helios
in recompense.&nbsp; They were dismayed at seeing the hides of
the slain beasts creep on the ground, and at hearing their flesh
low as it boiled in the cauldron.&nbsp; Indeed, Helios had gone
to Jupiter, and threatened to stop his chariot unless he had his
revenge; so as soon as the wretched crew embarked again a storm
arose, the ship was struck by lightning, and Ulysses alone was
saved from the wreck, floating on the mast.&nbsp; He came back
past Scylla and Charybdis, and, clinging to the fig tree which
hung over the latter, avoided being sucked into the whirlpool,
and by-and-by came to land in the island of the nymph Calypso,
who kept him eight years, but he pined for home all the time, and
at last built a raft on which to return.&nbsp; Neptune was not
weary of persecuting him, and raised another storm, which
shattered the raft, and threw Ulysses on the island of
Scheria.&nbsp; Here the king&rsquo;s fair daughter Nausicaa,
going down to the stream with her maidens to wash their robes,
met the shipwrecked stranger, and took him home.&nbsp; Her father
feasted him hospitably, and sent him home in a ship, which landed
him on the coast of Ithaca fast asleep, and left him there.&nbsp;
He had been absent twenty years; and Pallas further disguised his
aspect, so that he looked like a beggar, when, in order to see
how matters stood, he made his way first to the hut of his trusty
old swineherd Eum&aelig;us.</p>

91</span>Nothing could be worse than things were.&nbsp; More than
a hundred powerful young chiefs of the Ionian isles had taken
possession of his palace, and were daily revelling there,
thrusting his son Telemachus aside, and insisting that Penelope
should choose one of them as her husband.&nbsp; She could only
put them off by declaring she could wed no one till she had
finished the winding-sheet she was making for old Laertes, her
father-in-law; while to prevent its coming to an end she undid by
night whatever she wove by day.&nbsp; Telemachus had gone to seek
his father, but came home baffled to Eum&aelig;us&rsquo; <!--
page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>hut, and there was allowed to recognise Ulysses.&nbsp;
But it was as a beggar, broken-down and foot-sore, that Ulysses
sought his palace, and none knew him there but his poor old dog
Argus, who licked his feet, and died for joy.&nbsp; The suitors,
in their pride, made game of the poor stranger, but Penelope sent
for him, in case he brought news of her husband.&nbsp; Even to
her he told a feigned story, but she bade the old nurse Euryclea
take care of him, and wash his feet.&nbsp; While doing so, the
old woman knew him by a scar left by the tusk of a wild boar long
ago, and Ulysses could hardly stifle her cry of joy; but she told
him all, and who could be trusted among the slaves.&nbsp; The
plans were fixed.&nbsp; Telemachus, with much difficulty,
persuaded his mother to try to get rid of the suitors by
promising to wed him only who could bend Ulysses&rsquo;
bow.&nbsp; One after another tried in vain, and then, amid their
sneers, the beggar took it up, and bent it easily, hit the mark,
and then aimed it against them!&nbsp; They were all at the
banquet-table in the hall.&nbsp; Eum&aelig;us and the other
faithful servants had closed all the doors, and removed all the
arms, and there was a terrible slaughter both of these oppressors
and the servants who had joined with them against their queen and
her son.</p>
<p>After this, Ulysses made himself known to his wife, and
visited his father, who had long retired to his beautiful
garden.&nbsp; The kindred of the suitors would have made war on
him, but Pallas pacified them, and the <i>Odyssey</i> leaves him
to spend his old age in Ithaca, and <!-- page 93--><a

peaceful death.&nbsp; He was just what the Greeks thought a
thoroughly brave and wise man; for they had no notion that there
was any sin in falsehood and double-dealing.</p>

remember that Ulysses met Agamemnon among the other ghosts.&nbsp;
The King of Men, as the <i>Iliad</i> calls him, had vast beacons
lighted from isle to isle, and from cape to cape, to announce
that Troy was won, and that he was on his way home, little
knowing what a welcome was in store for him.</p>
<p>His wife Clytemnestra had never forgiven him for the loss of
Iphigenia, and had listened to his cousin &AElig;gisthus, who
wanted to marry her.&nbsp; She came forth and received Agamemnon
with apparent joy, but his poor captive Cassandra wailed aloud,
and would not cross the threshold, saying it streamed with blood,
and that this was a house of slaughter.&nbsp; No one listened to
her, and Agamemnon was led to the bath to refresh himself after
his journey.&nbsp; A new embroidered robe lay ready for him, but
the sleeves were sewn up at the wrists, and while he could not
get his hands free, &AElig;gisthus fell on him and slew him, and
poor Cassandra likewise.</p>
<p>His daughter Electra, fearing that her young brother <!-- page
95--><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>Orestes would not be safe since he was the right heir of
the kingdom, sent him secretly away to Phocis, where the king
bred him up with his own son Pylades, and the two youths loved
each other as much as Achilles and Patroclus had done.&nbsp; It
was the bounden duty of a son to be the avenger of his
father&rsquo;s blood, and after eight years, as soon as Orestes
was a grown warrior, he went with his friend in secret to
Mycen&aelig;, and offered a lock of his hair on his
father&rsquo;s tomb.&nbsp; Electra, coming out with her
offerings, found these tokens, and knew that he was near.&nbsp;
He made himself known, and she admitted him into the house, where
he fulfilled his stern charge, and killed both Clytemnestra and
&AElig;gisthus, then celebrated their funeral rites with all due
solemnity.</p>
<p>This was on the very day that Menelaus and Helen returned
home.&nbsp; They had been shipwrecked first in Egypt, where they
spent eight years, and then were held by contrary winds on a
little isle on the coast of Egypt, where they would have been
starved if Menelaus had not managed to capture the old sea-god
Proteus, when he came up to pasture his flock of seals on the
beach, and, holding him tight, while he changed into every kind
of queer shape, forced him at last to speak.&nbsp; By
Proteus&rsquo; advice, Menelaus returned to Egypt, and made the
sacrifices to the gods he had forgotten before, after which he
safely reached Sparta, on the day of Clytemnestra&rsquo;s
obsequies.&nbsp; Just as they were ended, the Furies, the
avengers of crime, fell upon Orestes for having slain his
mother.&nbsp; He fled in misery from <!-- page 96--><a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>Mycen&aelig;,
which Menelaus took into his own hands, while the wretched
Orestes went from place to place, still attended and comforted by
faithful Pylades, but he never tried to rest without being again
beset by the Furies.&nbsp; At last Apollo, at the oracle at
Delphi, sent him to take his trial at the court of justice at
Athens, called Areopagus, Ares&rsquo; (or Mars&rsquo;) Hill,
after which the oracle bade him fetch the image of Diana from
Tauris, marry his cousin Hermione, the daughter of Menelaus and
Helen, and recover his father&rsquo;s kingdom.</p>
<p>Pallas Athene came down to preside at Areopagus, and directed
the judges to pronounce that, though the slaying of a mother was
a fearful crime, yet it was Orestes&rsquo; duty to avenge his
father&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; He was therefore acquitted, and
purified by sacrifice, and was no more haunted by the Furies,
while with Pylades he sailed for Tauris.&nbsp; In that
inhospitable place it was the custom to sacrifice all strangers
to Diana, and, as soon as they had landed, Orestes and Pylades
were seized, and taken to the priestess at the temple, that their
hair might be cut and their brows wreathed for the
sacrifice.&nbsp; The priestess was no other than Iphigenia, who
had been snatched away from Aulis, and, when she and the brother,
whom she had left an infant, found each other out, she contrived
to leave the temple by night, carrying the image of Diana with
her.&nbsp; They went to Delphi together, and there Iphigenia met
Electra, who had heard a false report that her beloved Orestes
had been sacrificed by the priestess of Tauris, and was just
going <!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>to tear out her eyes, when Orestes
appeared, and the sisters were made known to each other.&nbsp; A
temple was built for the image near Marathon, in Attica, and
Iphigenia spent the rest of her life as priestess there.&nbsp;
Orestes, in the meantime, married Hermione&mdash;after, as some
say, killing Pyrrhus, the son of Achilles, to whom she was either
promised or married&mdash;and reigned over both Mycen&aelig; and
Sparta until the hundred years&rsquo; truce with the Heracleids,
or grandsons of Hercules, had come to an end, and they returned
with a party of Dorians and conquered Sparta, eighty years after
the Trojan war.</p>

98</span>This is the last of the events of the age of heroes,
when so much must be fable, though there may be a germ of
historical truth which no one can make out among the old tales
that had come from the East, and the like of which may be found
among the folk-lore of all nations.&nbsp; These are the most
famous of the stories, because they joined all Greeks together,
and were believed in by all Greeks alike in their main
circumstances; but every state had its own story, and one or two
may be told before we end this chapter of myths, because they are
often heard of, and poetry has been written about some of
them.</p>
<p>At Thebes, in B&oelig;otia, the king, Laius, was told that his
first child would be his death.&nbsp; So as soon as it was born
he had its ancles pierced, and put it out in a wood to die; but
it was found by a shepherd, and brought to Corinth, where the
queen named it &OElig;dipus, or Swollen Feet, and bred it up as
her own child.&nbsp; Many years later &OElig;dipus set out for
the Delphic oracle, to ask who he was; but all the answer he
received was that he must shun his native land, for he would be
the slayer of his own father.&nbsp; He therefore resolved not to
return to Corinth, but on his journey he met in a narrow pass
with a chariot going to Delphi.&nbsp; A quarrel arose, and in the
fight that followed he slew the man to whom the chariot belonged,
little knowing that it was Laius, his own father.</p>
<p>He then went on through B&oelig;otia.&nbsp; On the top of a
hill near Thebes sat a monster called the Sphinx, with <!-- page
99--><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>a
women&rsquo;s head, a lion&rsquo;s body, and an eagle&rsquo;s
wings.&nbsp; She had been taught riddles by the Muses, and
whoever failed to answer them she devoured upon the spot.&nbsp;
Whoever could answer her was to marry the king&rsquo;s sister,
and share the kingdom.&nbsp; &OElig;dipus went bravely up to her,
and heard her question, &ldquo;What is the animal that is at
first four-legged, then two-legged, then
three-legged?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Man,&rdquo; cried
&OElig;dipus.&nbsp; &ldquo;He creeps as a babe on all-fours,
walks upright in his prime, and uses a staff in his old
age.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thereupon the Sphinx turned to stone, and
&OElig;dipus married the princess, and reigned many years, till
there was a famine and pestilence, and the oracle was asked the
cause.&nbsp; It answered that the land must be purified from the
blood of Laius.&nbsp; Only then did &OElig;dipus find out that it
was Laius whom he had slain; and then, by the marks on his
ancles, it was proved that he was the babe who had been exposed,
so that he had fulfilled his fate, and killed his own
father.&nbsp; To save Thebes, he left the country, with his eyes
put out by way of expiation, and wandered about, only attended by
his faithful daughter Antigone, till he came to Athens, where,
like Orestes, he was sheltered, and allowed to expiate his
crime.&nbsp; After his death, Antigone came back to Thebes, where
her two brothers Eteocles and Polynices had agreed to reign each
a year by turns; but when Eteocles&rsquo; year was over he would
not give up to his brother, and Polynices, in a rage, collected
friends, among whom were six great chiefs, and attacked
Thebes.&nbsp; In the battle called &ldquo;The <!-- page 100--><a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>Seven
Chiefs against Thebes,&rdquo; all were slain, and Eteocles and
Polynices fell by each other&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; Their uncle
Creon forbade that the bodies of men who had so ruined their
country should receive funeral honours from anyone on pain of
death, thus condemning their shades to the dreary flitting about
on the banks of the Styx, so much dreaded.&nbsp; But their sister
Antigone, the noblest woman of Greek imagination, dared the
peril, stole forth at night, and gave burial alone to her two
brothers.&nbsp; She was found out, and put to death for her
sisterly devotion, though Creon&rsquo;s own son killed himself
for grief and love of her.&nbsp; This happened in the generation
before the Trojan war, for Tydeus, the father of Diomed, was one
of the seven chiefs.</p>
<p>Macedon, the country northward of Greece, had one very droll
legend.&nbsp; Midas, king of the Bryges, at the foot of Mount
Bermion, had a most beautiful garden, full of all kinds of
fruit.&nbsp; This was often stolen, until he watched, and found
the thief was old Silenus, the tutor of Bacchus.&nbsp; Thereupon
he filled with wine the fount where Silenus was used to drink
after his feast, and thus, instead of going away, the old god
fell asleep, and Midas caught him, and made him answer all his
questions.&nbsp; One was, &ldquo;What is best for man?&rdquo; and
the answer was very sad, &ldquo;What is best for man is never to
have been born.&nbsp; The second best is to die as soon as may
be.&rdquo;&nbsp; At last Silenus was released, on condition that
he would grant one wish, and this was that all that Midas touched
should turn to gold; and <!-- page 101--><a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>so it did,
clothes, food, and everything the king took hold of became solid
gold, so that he found himself starving, and entreated that the
gift might be taken away.&nbsp; So he was told to bathe in the
river Pactolus, in Lydia, and the sands became full of gold dust;
but, in remembrance of his folly, his ears grew long like those
of a donkey.&nbsp; He hid them by wearing a tall Phrygian cap,
and no one knew of them but his barber, who was told he should be
put to death if ever he mentioned these ears.&nbsp; The barber
was so haunted by the secret, that at last he could not help
relieving himself, by going to a clump of reeds and whispering
into them, &ldquo;King Midas has the ears of an ass;&rdquo; and
whenever the wind rustled in the reeds, those who went by might
always hear them in turn whisper to one another, &ldquo;King
Midas has the ears of an ass.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some accounts say that
it was for saying that Pan was a better musician than Apollo that
Midas had his ass&rsquo;s ears, and that it was Lydia of which he
was king; and this seems most likely, for almost as many Greeks
lived in the borders of Asia Minor as lived in Greece itself, and
there were many stories of the hills, cities, and rivers there,
but I have only told you what is most needful to be
known&mdash;not, of course, to be believed, but to be known.</p>

<h2>CHAP. XII.&mdash;AFTER THE HEROIC AGE.</h2>
<p>
<img class='dc' alt='A' title='A' src='images/dca.jpg' />ll these
heroes of whom we have been telling lived, if they lived at all,
about the time of the Judges of Israel.&nbsp; Troy is thought to
have been taken at the time that Saul was reigning in Israel, and
there is no doubt that there once was a city between Mount Ida
and the &AElig;gean Sea, for quantities of remains have been dug
up, and among them many rude earthenware images of an owl, the
emblem of Pallas Athene, likenesses perhaps of the
Palladium.&nbsp; Hardly anything is told either false or true of
Greece for three hundred years after this time, and when
something more like history begins we find that all Greece, small
as it is, was divided into very small states, each of which had a
chief city and a government of its own, and was generally shut in
from its neighbours by mountains or by sea.&nbsp; There were the
three tribes, Ionian, Dorian, and &AElig;olian, dwelling in these
little states, and, though they often quarrelled among
themselves, all thinking themselves one nation, together with
their kindred in the islands of the &AElig;gean, on the coasts of
Asia, and also in Sicily and Southern Italy, which was sometimes
called Greater Greece.</p>
<p><!-- page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>Some time between the heroic age and the historical
time, there had been a great number of songs and verses composed
telling of the gods and heroes.&nbsp; Singers and poets used to
be entertained by the kings, and sometimes to wander from one
place to another, welcomed by all, as they chanted to the harp or
the lyre the story of the great forefathers of their hosts,
especially when they had all joined together, as in the hunt of
the great boar of Calydon, in the voyage for the Golden Fleece,
and, above all, in the siege of Troy.&nbsp; The greatest of all
these singers was the blind poet Homer, whose songs of the wrath
of Achilles and the wanderings of Ulysses were loved and learnt
by everyone.&nbsp; Seven different cities claimed to be his
birth-place, but no one knows more about him than that he was
blind&mdash;not even exactly when he lived&mdash;but his poems
did much to make the Greeks hold together.</p>
<p>And so did their religion.&nbsp; Everybody sent to ask
questions of the oracle of Apollo at Delphi, and there really
were answers to them, though no one can tell by what power.&nbsp;
And at certain times there were great festivals at certain
shrines.&nbsp; One was at Olympia, in Elis, where there was a
great festival every five years.&nbsp; It was said that Hercules,
when a little boy, had here won a foot-race with his brothers,
and when the Heracleids returned to Sparta they founded a feast,
with games for all the Greeks to contend in.&nbsp; There were
chariot races, horse races, foot races, boxing and wrestling
matches, throwing weights, playing with <!-- page 104--><a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>quoits,
singing and reciting of poems.&nbsp; The winner was rewarded with
a wreath of bay, of pine, of parsley, or the like, and he wore
such an one as his badge of honour for the rest of his
life.&nbsp; Nothing was thought more of than being first in the
Olympic games, and the Greeks even came to make them their
measure of time, saying that any event happened in such and such
a year of such an Olympiad.&nbsp; The first Olympiad they counted
from was the year 776 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, that is,
before the coming of our blessed Lord.&nbsp; There were other
games every three years, which Theseus was said to have
instituted, on the isthmus of Corinth, called the Isthmean Games,
and others in two different places, and no honour was more highly
esteemed than success in these.</p>
<p>There were also councils held of persons chosen from each
tribe, called Amphictyons, for arranging their affairs, both
religious and worldly, and one great Amphictyonic council, which
met near Delphi, to discuss the affairs of all Greece.&nbsp; In
truth, all the great nations who long ago parted in Asia have had
somewhat the same arrangement.&nbsp; A family grew first into a
clan, then into a tribe, then into a nation, and the nation that
settled in one country formed fresh family divisions of clans,
tribes, and families.&nbsp; At first the father of a family would
take council with the sons, the head of a clan with the fathers
of families, the chief of a tribe with the heads of clans, and as
these heads of clans grew into little kings, the ablest of them
would lead the nation in time of war, as Agamemnon did the chiefs
<!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>against Troy.&nbsp; However, the Greeks seem for the
most part, between the heroic and historical ages, to have
dropped the king or chief of each state, and only to have managed
them by various councils of the chief heads of families, who were
called <i>aristoi</i>, the best, while those who were not usually
called into council, though they too were free, and could choose
their governors, and vote in great matters, were termed
<i>demos</i>, the people.&nbsp; This is why we hear of
aristocracy and democracy.&nbsp; Under these freemen were the
people of the country they had conquered, or any slaves they had
bought or taken captive, or strangers who had come to live in the
place, and these had no rights at all.</p>
<p>Greek cities were generally beautiful places, in valleys
between the hills and the sea.&nbsp; They were sure to have
several temples to the gods of the place.&nbsp; These were
colonnades of stone-pillars, upon steps, open all round, but with
a small dark cell in the middle, which was the shrine of the god,
whose statue, and carvings of whose adventures, adorned the
outside.&nbsp; There was an altar in the open-air for sacrifices,
the flesh of which was afterwards eaten.&nbsp; In the middle of a
town was always a market-place, which served as the
assembling-place of the people, and it had a building attached to
it where the fire of Vesta was never allowed to go out.&nbsp; The
charge of it was given to the best men who could be found; and
when a set of citizens went forth to make a new home or colony in
Asia, Sicily, or Italy, they always took brands from this fire,
guarded them <!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>carefully in a censer, and lighted
their altar-fires therefrom when they settled down.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p106.jpg">
<img alt=
"Greek Interior"

</a></p>
<p>These cities were of houses built round paved courts.&nbsp;
The courts had generally a fountain in the middle, and an altar
to the hero forefather of the master, where, before each meal,
offerings were made and wine poured out.&nbsp; The rooms were
very small, and used for little but sleeping; and the men lived
chiefly in the cloister or pillared walks round the court.&nbsp;
There was a kind of back-court for the women of the family, who
did not often appear in the front one, though they were not shut
up like Eastern women.&nbsp; Most Greeks had farms, which they
worked by the help of their slaves, and whence came the meat,
corn, wine, and milk that <!-- page 107--><a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>maintained
the family.&nbsp; The women spun the wool of the sheep, wove and
embroidered it, making for the men short tunics reaching to the
knee, with a longer mantle for dignity or for need; and for
themselves long robes 
<a href="images/p107.jpg">
<img alt=
"Greek robe"
title=
"Greek robe"
src="images/p107.jpg" />
</a> reaching to the feet&mdash;a modest and graceful
covering&mdash;but leaving the arms bare.&nbsp; Men cut their
hair close; women folded their tresses round their heads in the
simplest and most becoming manner that has yet been
invented.&nbsp; The feet were bare, but sandalled, and the
sandals fastened with ornamented thongs.&nbsp; Against the sun
sometimes a sort of hat was worn, or the mantle was put over the
head, and women had thick veils wrapping them.</p>
<p>In time of war the armour was a helmet with a horse-hair
crest, a breast-plate on a leathern cuirass, which had strips of
leather hanging from the lower edge as far down as the knee;
sometimes greaves to guard the leathern buskin; a round shield of
leather, faced with metal, and often beautifully ornamented; and
also spears, swords, daggers, and sometimes bows and
arrows.&nbsp; Chariots for war had been left off since the heroic
times; indeed Greece was so hilly that horses were not very much
used in battle, though riding was part of the training of a
Greek, and the Thessalian <!-- page 108--><a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>horses were
much valued.&nbsp; Every state that had a seaboard had its fleet
of galleys, with benches of oars; but the Greek sailors seldom
ventured out of sight of land, and all that Greece or Asia Minor
did not produce was brought by the Ph&oelig;nicians, the great
sailors, merchants, and slave-dealers of the Old World.&nbsp;
They brought Tyrian purple, gold of Ophir, silver of Spain, tin
of Gaul and Britain, ivory from India, and other such luxuries;
and they also bought captives in war, or kidnapped children on
the coast, and sold them as slaves.&nbsp; Ulysses&rsquo; faithful
swineherd was such a slave, and of royal birth; and such was the
lot of many an Israelite child, for whom its parents&rsquo;
&ldquo;eyes failed with looking and longing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
<a href="images/p108.jpg">
<img class="floatleft" alt=

</a>The Greeks had more power of thought and sense of grace than
any other people have ever had.&nbsp; They always had among them
men seeking for truth and beauty.&nbsp; The truth-seekers were
called philosophers, or lovers of wisdom.&nbsp; They were always
trying to understand about God and man, and this world, and
guessing at something great, far beyond the stories of Jupiter;
and they used to gather young men round them under the pillared
porches and talk over these thoughts, or write them in beautiful
words.&nbsp; Almost all the <!-- page 109--><a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>sciences
began with the Greeks; their poems and their histories are
wonderfully written; and they had such great men among them that,
though most of their little states were smaller than an ordinary
English county, and the whole of them together do not make a
country as large as Ireland, their history is the most remarkable
in the world, except that of the Jews.&nbsp; The history of the
Jews shows what God does for men; the history of Greece shows
what man does left to himself.</p>
<p>Greece was not so small as what is called Greece now in our
modern maps.&nbsp; It reached northwards as far as the Volutza
and Khimera mountains, beyond which lay Macedon, where the people
called themselves Greeks, but were not quite accepted as
such.&nbsp; In this peninsula, together with the Peloponnesus and
the isles, there were twenty little states, making up Hellas, or
Greece. <a name="citation109"></a><a href="#footnote109"

remember that after a hundred years the grandsons of Hercules
returned, bringing with them their followers of Dorian birth, and
conquered Laconia.&nbsp; These Dorians called themselves
Spartans, and were the rulers of the land, though the Greeks, who
were there before them, were also freemen, all but those of one
city, called Helos, which revolted, and was therefore broken up,
and the people were called Helots, and became slaves to the
Spartans.&nbsp; One of the Spartan kings, sons of Hercules, had
twin sons, and these two reigned together with equal rights, and
so did their sons after them, so that there were always two kings
at Sparta.&nbsp; One line was called the Agids, from Agis, its
second king; the other Eurypontids, from Eurypon, its third king,
instead of from the two original twins.</p>
<p>The affairs of Sparta had fallen into a corrupt state by the
third generation after Eurypon.&nbsp; The king of his line was
killed in a quarrel, and his widow, a wicked <!-- page 111--><a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>woman,
offered his brother Lycurgus to kill her little new-born babe, if
he would marry her, that she might continue to be queen.&nbsp;
Lycurgus did not show his horror, but advised her to send the
child alive to him, that he might dispose of it.&nbsp; So far
from killing it was he, that he carried it at once to the
council, placed it on the throne, and proclaimed it as Charilaus,
king of Sparta.</p>
<p>There were still murmurs from those who did not know that
Lycurgus had saved the little boy&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; As he was
next heir to the throne, it was thought that he must want to put
Charilaus out of the way, so as to reign himself; so, having seen
the boy in safe keeping, Lycurgus went on his travels to study
the laws and ways of other countries.&nbsp; He visited Crete, and
learnt the laws of Minos; and, somewhere among the Greek
settlements in Asia, he is said to have seen and talked to Homer,
and heard his songs.&nbsp; He also went to Egypt, and after that
to India, where he may have learnt much from the old Brahmin
philosophy; and then, having made his plan, he repaired to
Delphi, and prayed until he received answer from Apollo that his
laws should be the best, and the state that obeyed them the most
famous in Greece.&nbsp; He then went home, where he had been much
missed, for his young nephew Charilaus, though grown to
man&rsquo;s estate, was too weak and good-natured to be much
obeyed, and there was a great deal of idleness, and gluttony, and
evil of all sorts prevailing.</p>
<p>Thirty Spartans bound themselves to help Lycurgus in his
reform, and Charilaus, fancying it a league against <!-- page
112--><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>himself, fled into the temple of Pallas, but his uncle
fetched him out, and told him that he only wanted to make laws
for making the Spartans great and noble.&nbsp; The rule was only
for the real Dorian Spartans, the masters of the country, and was
to make them perfect warriors.&nbsp; First, then, he caused all
the landmarks to be taken up, and the lands thrown into one,
which he divided again into lots, each of which was large enough
to yield 82 bushels of corn in a year, with wine and oil in
proportion.&nbsp; Then, to hinder hoarding, he allowed no money
to be used in the country but great iron weights, so that a small
sum took up a great deal of room, and could hardly be carried
about, and thus there was no purchasing Ph&oelig;nician luxuries;
nor was anyone to use gold or ivory, soft cushions, carpets, or
the like, as being unworthy of the race of Hercules.&nbsp; The
whole Spartan nation became, in fact, a regiment of
highly-disciplined warriors.&nbsp; They were to live together in
public barracks, only now and then visiting their homes, and even
when they slept there, being forbidden to touch food till they
came to the general meal, which was provided for by contributions
of meal, cheese, figs, and wine from each man&rsquo;s farm, and a
little money to buy fish and meat; also a sort of soup called
black broth, which was so unsavoury that nobody but a Spartan
could eat it, because it was said they brought the best sauce,
namely, hunger.&nbsp; A boy was admitted as soon as he was old
enough, and was warned against repeating the talk of his elders,
by being told on his first entrance, by the eldest man in the
<!-- page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>company, &ldquo;Look you, sir; nothing said here goes
out there.&rdquo;&nbsp; Indeed no one used more words than
needful, so that short, pithy sayings came to be called
Laconic.&nbsp; To be a perfect soldier was the great point, so
boys were taught that no merit was greater than bearing pain
without complaint; and they carried this so far, that a boy who
had brought a young wolf into the hall, hidden under his tunic,
let it bite him even to death without a groan or cry.&nbsp; It is
said that they were trained to theft, and were punished, not for
the stealing, but the being found out.&nbsp; And, above all, no
Spartan was ever to turn his back in battle.&nbsp; The mothers
gave the sons a shield, with the words, &ldquo;With it, or on
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Spartan shields were long, so that a dead
warrior would be borne home on his shield; but a man would not
dare show his face again if he had thrown it away in
flight.&nbsp; The women were trained to running, leaping, and
throwing the bar, like the men, and were taught stern hardihood,
so that, when their boys were offered to the cruel Diana, they
saw them flogged to death at her altar without a tear.&nbsp; All
the lives of the Spartans were spent in exercising for war, and
the affairs of the state were managed not so much by the kings,
but by five judges called Ephors, who were chosen every year,
while the kings had very little power.&nbsp; They had to undergo
the same discipline as the rest&mdash;dressed, ate, and lived
like them; but they were the high priests and chief captains, and
made peace or war.</p>
<p>At first Lycurgus&rsquo; laws displeased some of the <!-- page
114--><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>citizens much, and, when he was proposing them, a young
man named Alcander struck him on the face with his staff, and put
out his eye.&nbsp; The others were shocked, and put Alcander into
Lycurgus&rsquo; hands, to be punished as he thought fit.&nbsp;
All Lycurgus did was to make him wait upon him at meals, and
Alcander was so touched and won over that he became one of his
best supporters.&nbsp; After having fully taught Sparta to
observe his rule, Lycurgus declared that he had another journey
to take, and made the people swear to observe his laws till he
came back again.&nbsp; He never did come back, and they held
themselves bound by them for ever.</p>
<p>This story of Lycurgus has been doubted, but whether there
were such a man or not, it is quite certain that these were the
laws of Sparta in her most famous days, and that they did their
work of making brave and hardy soldiers.&nbsp; The rule was much
less strict in the camp than the city, and the news of a war was
delightful to the Spartans as a holiday-time.&nbsp; All the hard
work of their farms was done for them by the Helots, who were
such a strong race that it was not easy to keep them down,
although their masters were very cruel to them, often killing
large numbers of them if they seemed to be growing dangerous,
always ill-treating them, and, it is said, sometimes making them
drunk, that the sight of their intoxication might disgust the
young Spartans.&nbsp; In truth, the whole Spartan system was hard
and unfeeling, and much fitter to make fighting machines than
men.</p>
<p><!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>The first great Spartan war that we know of was with
their neighbours of Messenia, who stood out bravely, but were
beaten, and brought down to the state of Helots in the year 723
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, all but a small band, who fled
into other states.&nbsp; Among them was born a brave youth named
Aristomenes, who collected all the boldest of his
fellow-Messenians to try to save their country, and Argos,
Arcadia, and Elis joined with them.&nbsp; Several battles were
fought.&nbsp; One, which was called the battle of the
Boar&rsquo;s Pillar, was long sung about.&nbsp; An augur had told
Aristomenes that under a tree sat the Spartan brothers Castor and
Pollux, to protect their countrymen, and that he might not pass
it; but in the pursuit he rushed by it, and at that moment the
shield was rent from him by an unseen hand.&nbsp; While he was
searching for it, the Spartans (who do seem this time to have
fled) escaped; but Messene was free, and he was crowned with
flowers by the rejoicing women.&nbsp; A command from Apollo made
him descend into a cave, where he found his shield, adorned with
the figure of an eagle, and, much encouraged, he won another
battle, and would have entered Sparta itself, had not Helen and
her twin brothers appeared to warn him back.&nbsp; At last,
however, the war turned against him, and in a battle on Laconian
ground he was stunned by a stone, and taken prisoner, with 50
more.&nbsp; They were all condemned to be thrown down a high rock
into a deep pit.&nbsp; Everyone else was killed by the fall, but
Aristomenes found himself unhurt, with sky above, high <!-- page
116--><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>precipices on all sides, and his dead comrades under
him.&nbsp; He wrapped himself in his cloak to wait for death, but
on the third day he heard something moving, uncovered his face,
and saw that a fox had crept in from a cavern at the side of the
pit.&nbsp; He took hold of the fox&rsquo;s tail, crawled after
it, and at last saw the light of day.&nbsp; He scraped the earth
till the way was large enough for him to pass, escaped, and
gathered his friends, to the amazement of the Spartans.&nbsp;
Again he gained the victory, and a truce was made, but he was
treacherously seized, and thrown into prison.&nbsp; However, this
time he was set free by a maiden, whom he gave in marriage to his
son.&nbsp; At last Eira, the chief city of Messenia, was betrayed
by a foolish woman, while Aristomenes was laid aside by a
wound.&nbsp; In spite of this, however, he fought for three days
and nights against the Spartans, and at last drew up all the
survivors&mdash;women as well as men&mdash;in a hollow square,
with the children in the middle, and demanded a free
passage.&nbsp; The Spartans allowed these brave Messenians to
pass untouched, and they reached Arcadia.&nbsp; There the
dauntless Aristomenes arranged another scheme for seizing Sparta
itself, but it was betrayed, and failed.&nbsp; The Arcadians
stoned the traitor, while the gentle Aristomenes wept for
him.&nbsp; The remaining Messenians begged him to lead them to a
new country, but he would not leave Greece as long as he could
strike a blow against Sparta.&nbsp; However, he sent his two
sons, and they founded in Sicily a new Messene, which we still
call Messina.&nbsp; <!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>Aristomenes waited in vain in
Arcadia, till Damagetus, king of Rhodes, who had been bidden by
an oracle to marry the daughter of the best of Greeks, asked for
the daughter of Aristomenes, and persuaded him to finish his life
in peace and honour in Rhodes.</p>

the Peloponnesus, jutting out into the &AElig;gean Sea, lay the
rocky little Ionian state of Attica, with its lovely city,
Athens.&nbsp; There was a story that Neptune and Pallas Athene
had had a strife as to which should be the patron of the city,
and that it was to be given to whichever should produce the most
precious gift for it.&nbsp; Neptune struck the earth with his
trident, and there appeared a war-horse; but Pallas&rsquo; touch
brought forth an olive-tree, and this was judged the most useful
gift.&nbsp; The city bore her name; the tiny Athenian owl was her
badge; the very olive-tree she had bestowed was said to be that
which grew in the court of the Acropolis, a sacred citadel on a
rock above the city; and near at hand was her temple, called the
Parthenon, or Virgin&rsquo;s Shrine.&nbsp; Not far off was the
Areopagus, a Hill of Ares, or Mars, the great place for hearing
causes and doing justice; and below these there grew up a city
filled with men as brave as the Spartans, <!-- page 119--><a

more thoughtful and wise, besides having a most perfect taste and

<p>The Athenians claimed Theseus as their greatest king and first
lawgiver.&nbsp; It was said that, when the Dorians were
conquering the Peloponnesus, they came north and attacked Attica,
but were told by an oracle that they never would succeed if they
slew the king of Athens.&nbsp; Codrus, who was then king of
Athens, heard of this oracle, and devoted himself for his
country.&nbsp; He found that in battle the Dorians always forbore
to strike <!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>him, and he therefore disguised
himself, went into the enemy&rsquo;s camp, quarrelled with a
soldier there, and thus caused himself to be killed, so as to
save his country.&nbsp; He was the last king.&nbsp; The Athenians
would not have anyone less noble to sit in his seat, and
appointed magistrates called Archons in the stead of kings.</p>
<p>Soon they fell into a state of misrule and disorder, and they
called on a philosopher named Draco to draw up laws for
them.&nbsp; Draco&rsquo;s laws were good, but very strict, and
for the least crime the punishment was death.&nbsp; Nobody could
keep them, so they were set aside and forgotten, and confusion
grew worse, till another wise lawgiver named Solon undertook to
draw up a fresh code of laws for them.</p>
<p>Solon was one of the seven wise men of Greece, who all lived
at the same time.&nbsp; The other six were Thales, Bion,
Pittacus, Cleobulus, Chilo, and Periander.&nbsp; This last was
called Tyrant of Corinth.&nbsp; When the ancient Greeks spoke of
a tyrant, they did not mean a cruel king so much as a king who
had not been heir to the crown, but had taken to himself the rule
over a free people.&nbsp; A very curious story belongs to
Periander, for we have not quite parted with the land of
fable.&nbsp; It is about the poet Arion, who lived chiefly with
him at Corinth, but made one voyage to Sicily.&nbsp; As he was
coming back, the sailors plotted to throw him overboard, and
divide the gifts he was bringing with him.&nbsp; When he found
they were resolved, he only begged to play once more on his lyre;
then, standing on the prow, <!-- page 121--><a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>he played
and sung a hymn calling the gods to his aid.&nbsp; So sweet were
the sounds that shoals of dolphins came round the ship, and
Arion, leaping from the prow, placed himself on the back of one,
which bore him safely to land.&nbsp; Periander severely punished
the treacherous sailors.&nbsp; Some think that this story was a
Greek alteration of the history of Jonah, which might have been
brought by the Ph&oelig;nician sailors.</p>
<p>Solon was Athenian by birth, and of the old royal line.&nbsp;
He had served his country in war, and had travelled to study the
habits of other lands, when the Athenians, wearied with the
oppressions of the rich and great, and finding that no one
attended to the laws of Draco, left it to him to form a new
constitution.&nbsp; It would be of no use to try to explain it
all.&nbsp; The chief thing to be remembered about it is, that at
the head of the government were nine chief magistrates, who were
called Archons, and who were changed every three years.&nbsp; To
work with them, there was a council of four hundred
<i>aristoi</i>, or nobles; but when war or peace was decided, the
whole <i>demos</i>, or people, had to vote, according to their
tribes; and if a man was thought to be dangerous to the state,
the <i>demos</i> might sentence him to be banished.&nbsp; His
name was written on an oyster shell, or on a tile, by those who
wished him to be driven away, and these were thrown into one
great vessel.&nbsp; If they amounted to a certain number, the man
was said to be &ldquo;ostracised,&rdquo; and forced to leave the
city.&nbsp; This was sometimes done very unjustly, but it
answered the <!-- page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 122</span>purpose of sending away rich men who
became overbearing, and kept tyrants from rising up.&nbsp; There
were no unnatural laws as there were at Sparta; people might live
at home as they pleased; but there were schools, and all the
youths were to be taught there, both learning and training in all
exercises.&nbsp; And whether it was from Solon&rsquo;s laws or
their own character, there certainly did arise in Athens some of
the greatest and noblest men of all times.</p>
<p>After having set things in order, Solon is said to have been
so annoyed by foolish questions on his schemes, that he went
again on his travels.&nbsp; First he visited his friend Thales,
at Miletus, in Asia Minor; and, finding him rich and comfortable,
he asked why he had never married.&nbsp; Thales made no answer
then, but a few days later he brought in a stranger, who, he
said, was just from Athens.&nbsp; Solon asked what was the
news.&nbsp; &ldquo;A great funeral was going on, and much
lamentation,&rdquo; said the man.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whose was
it?&rdquo;&nbsp; He did not learn the name, but it was a young
man of great promise, whose father was abroad upon his
travels.&nbsp; &ldquo;The father was much famed for his wisdom
and justice.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Was it Solon?&rdquo; cried the
listener.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was.&rdquo;&nbsp; Solon burst into
tears, tore his hair, and beat his breast; but Thales took his
hand, saying, &ldquo;Now you see, O Solon, why I have never
married, lest I should expose myself to griefs such as
these;&rdquo; and then told him it was all a trick.&nbsp; Solon
could not much have approved such a trick, for when Thespis, a
great actor of plays, came to <!-- page 123--><a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>Athens,
Solon asked him if he were not ashamed to speak so many
falsehoods.&nbsp; Thespis answered that it was all in
sport.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Solon, striking his staff on
the ground; &ldquo;but he that tells lies in sport will soon tell
them in earnest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this, Solon went on to Lydia.&nbsp; This was a kingdom
of Greek settlers in Asia Minor, where flowed that river
Pactolus, whose sands contained gold-dust, from King Midas&rsquo;
washing, as the story went.&nbsp; The king was Cr&oelig;sus, who
was exceedingly rich and splendid.&nbsp; He welcomed Solon, and,
after showing him all his glory, asked whom the philosopher
thought the happiest of men.&nbsp; &ldquo;An honest man named
Tellus,&rdquo; said Solon, &ldquo;who lived uprightly, was
neither rich nor poor, had good children, and died bravely for
his country.&rdquo;&nbsp; Cr&oelig;sus was vexed, but asked who
was next happiest.&nbsp; &ldquo;Two brothers named Cleobis and
Bito,&rdquo; said Solon, &ldquo;who were so loving and dutiful to
their mother, that, when she wanted to go to the temple of Juno,
they yoked themselves to her car, and drew her thither; then,
having given this proof of their love, they lay down to sleep,
and so died without pain or grief.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And what
do you think of me?&rdquo; said Cr&oelig;sus.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Solon, &ldquo;call no man happy till he is
dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cr&oelig;sus was mortified at such a rebuff to his pride, and
neglected Solon.&nbsp; There was a clever crooked Egyptian slave
at Cr&oelig;sus&rsquo; court, called &AElig;sop, who gave his
advice in the form of the fables we know so well, such as the
wolf and the lamb, the fox and the grapes, etc.; <!-- page
124--><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>though, as the Hindoos and Persians have from old times
told the same stories, it would seem as if &AElig;sop only
repeated them, but did not invent them.&nbsp; When &AElig;sop saw
Solon in the background, he said, &ldquo;Solon, visits to kings
should be seldom, or else pleasant.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Solon; &ldquo;visits to kings should be
seldom, or else profitable,&rdquo; as the courtly slave found
them.&nbsp; &AElig;sop came to a sad end.&nbsp; Cr&oelig;sus sent
him to Delphi to distribute a sum of money among the poor, but
they quarrelled so about it that &AElig;sop said he should take
it back to the king, and give none at all; whereupon the
Delphians, in a rage, threw him off a precipice, and killed
him.</p>
<p>Cr&oelig;sus was just thinking of going to war with the great
Cyrus, king of the Medes and Persians, the same who overcame
Assyria, took Babylon, and restored Jerusalem, and who was now
subduing Asia Minor.&nbsp; Cr&oelig;sus asked council of all the
oracles, but first he tried their truth.&nbsp; He bade his
messenger ask the oracle at Delphi what he was doing while they
were inquiring.&nbsp; The answer was&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Lo, on my sense striketh the smell of a
shell-covered tortoise<br />
Boiling on the fire, with the flesh of a lamb, in a cauldron;<br
/>
Brass is the vessel below, brass the cover above it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cr&oelig;sus was really, as the most unlikely thing to be
guessed, boiling a tortoise and a lamb together in a brazen
vessel.&nbsp; Sure now of the truth of the oracle, he sent
splendid gifts, and asked whether he should go to war with
Cyrus.&nbsp; The answer was that, if he did, a mighty kingdom
would be overthrown.</p>
<p><!-- page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>He thought it meant the Persian, but it was his
own.&nbsp; Lydia was overcome, Sardis, his capital, was burnt,
and he was about to be slain, when, remembering the warning,
&ldquo;Call no man happy till his death,&rdquo; he cried out,
&ldquo;O Solon, Solon, Solon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cyrus heard him, and bade that he should be asked what it
meant.&nbsp; The story so struck the great king, that he spared
Cr&oelig;sus, and kept him as his adviser for the rest of his
life.</p>

<img class='dc' alt='A' title='A' src='images/dca.jpg' />fter all
the pains that Solon had taken to guard the freedom of the
Athenians, his system had hardly begun to work before his kinsman
Pisistratus, who was also of the line of Codrus, overthrew
it.&nbsp; First this man pretended to have been nearly murdered,
and obtained leave to have a guard of fifty men, armed with
clubs; and with these he made everyone afraid of him, so that he
had all the power, and became tyrant of Athens.&nbsp; He was once
driven out, but he found a fine, tall, handsome woman, a
flower-girl, in one of the villages of Attica, dressed her in
helmet and cuirass, like the goddess Pallas, and came into Athens
in a chariot with her, when she presented him to the people as
their ruler.&nbsp; The common people thought she was their
goddess, and Pisistratus had friends among the rich, so he
recovered his power, and he did not, on the whole, use it
badly.&nbsp; He made a kind law, decreeing that a citizen who had
been maimed in battle should be provided for by the State, and he
was the first Greek to found a <!-- page 127--><a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>library,
and collect books&mdash;namely, manuscripts upon the sheets of
the rind of the Egyptian paper-rush, or else upon skins.&nbsp; He
was also the first person to collect and arrange the poems of
Homer.&nbsp; Everybody seems to have known some part by heart,
but they were in separate songs, and Pisistratus first had them
written down and put in order, after which no Greek was thought
an educated man unless he thoroughly knew the <i>Iliad</i> and
<i>Odyssey</i>.</p>
<p>Pisistratus ruled for thirty-three years, and made the
Athenians content, and when he died his sons Hippias and
Hipparchus ruled much as he had done, and gave no cause for
complaint.&nbsp; One thing they did was to set up mile-stones all
over the roads of Attica, each with a bust of Mercury on the top,
and a wise proverb carved below the number of the miles.&nbsp;
But they grew proud and insolent, and one day a damsel of high
family was rudely sent away from a solemn religious procession,
because Hipparchus had a quarrel with her brother
Harmodius.&nbsp; This only made Harmodius vow vengeance, and,
together with his friend Aristogeiton, he made a plot with other
youths for surrounding the two brothers at a great festival, when
everyone carried myrtle-boughs, as well as their swords and
shields.&nbsp; The conspirators had daggers hidden in the myrtle,
and succeeded in killing Hipparchus, but Harmodius was killed on
the spot, and Aristogeiton was taken and tortured to make him
reveal his other accomplices, and so was a girl named
Le&oelig;na, who was known to have <!-- page 128--><a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>been in
their secrets; but she bore all the pain without a word, and when
it was over she was found to have bitten off her tongue, that she
might not betray her friends.&nbsp; Hippias kept up his rule for
a few years longer, but he found all going against him, and that
the people were bent on having Solon&rsquo;s system back; so,
fearing for his life, he sent away his wife and children, and
soon followed them to Asia, <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
510.&nbsp; This&mdash;which is called the Expulsion of the
Pisistratids&mdash;was viewed by the Athenians as the beginning
of their freedom.&nbsp; They paid yearly honours to the memory of
the murderers Harmodius and Aristogeiton; and as Le&oelig;na
means a lioness, they honoured that brave woman&rsquo;s constancy
with the statue of a lioness without a tongue.</p>
<p>Hippias wandered about for some time, and ended by going to
the court of the king of Persia.&nbsp; Cyrus was now dead, after
having established a great empire, which spread from the Persian
Gulf to the shore of the Mediterranean, and had Babylon for one
of its capitals.&nbsp; When Cr&oelig;sus was conquered, almost
all the Greek colonies along the coast of Asia Minor likewise
fell to the &ldquo;Great King,&rdquo; as his subjects called
him.&nbsp; The Persians adored the sun and fire as emblems of the
great God, and thought the king himself had something of divinity
in his person, and therefore, like most Eastern kings, he had
entire power over his people for life or death; they were all his
slaves, and the only thing he could not do was to change his own
decrees.</p>

<p>After the Asian coast, the isles of the &AElig;gean stood <!--
page 129--><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>next in the way of the Persian.&nbsp; In the little
isle of Samos lived a king called Polycrates, who had always been
wealthy and prosperous.&nbsp; His friend Amasis, king of Egypt,
told him that the gods were always jealous of the fortunate, and
that, if he wished to avert some terrible disaster, he had better
give up something very precious.&nbsp; Upon this Polycrates took
off his beautiful signet ring and threw it into the sea; but a
few days later a large fish was brought as a present to the king,
and when it was cut up the ring was found in its stomach, and
restored to Polycrates.&nbsp; Upon this Amasis <!-- page 130--><a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>renounced
his friendship, declaring that, as the gods threw back his
offering, something dreadful was before him.&nbsp; The foreboding
came sadly true, for the Persian satrap, or governor, of Sardis,
being envious of Polycrates, declared that the Ionian was under
the Great King&rsquo;s displeasure, and invited him to Sardis to
clear himself.&nbsp; Polycrates set off, but was seized as soon
as he landed in Asia, and hung upon a cross.</p>
<p>Amasis himself died just as the Persians were coming to attack
Egypt, which Cyrus&rsquo; son Cambyses entirely conquered, and
added to the Persian empire; but Cambyses shortly after lost his
senses and died, and there was an unsettled time before a very
able and spirited king named Darius obtained the crown, and
married Cyrus&rsquo; daughter Atossa.&nbsp; Among the prisoners
made at Samos there was a physician named Democedes, who was
taken to Susa, Darius&rsquo; capital.&nbsp; He longed to get
home, and tried not to show how good a doctor he was; but the
king one day hurt his foot, and, when all the Persian doctors
failed to cure him, he sent for Democedes, who still pretended to
be no wiser, until torture was threatened, and he was forced to
try his skill.&nbsp; Darius recovered, made him great gifts, and
sent him to attend his wives; but Democedes still pined for home,
and managed to persuade Atossa to beg the king to give her
Spartan and Athenian slaves, and to tell him some great
undertaking was expected from him.&nbsp; The doctor&rsquo;s hope
in this was that he should be sent as a spy to Greece, before the
war, and should make his escape; <!-- page 131--><a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>but it was
a bad way of showing love to his country.&nbsp; Hippias was at
Susa too, trying to stir up Darius to attack Athens, and restore
him as a tributary king; and there was also Histi&aelig;us, a
Greek, who had been tyrant of Miletus, and who longed to get
home.&nbsp; All the Ionian Greeks on the coast of Asia Minor
hated the Persian rule, and Histi&aelig;us hoped that if they
revolted he should be wanted there, so he sent a letter to his
friend Aristagoras, at Miletus, in a most curious way.&nbsp; He
had the head of a trusty slave shaved, then, with a red-hot pin,
wrote his advice to rise against the Persians, and, when the hair
was grown again, sent the man as a present to Aristagoras, with
orders to tell him to shave his head.</p>
<p>Aristagoras read the letter, and went to Sparta to try to get
the help of the kings in attacking Persia.&nbsp; He took with him
a brass plate, engraven with a map of the world, according to the
notions of the time, where it looked quite easy to march to Susa,
and win the great Eastern empire.&nbsp; At first Cleomenes, the
most spirited of the kings, was inclined to listen, but when he
found that this easy march would take three months he changed his
mind, and thought it beyond Spartan powers.&nbsp; Aristagoras
went secretly to his house, and tried to bribe him, at least, to
help the Ionians in their rising; but while higher and higher
offers were being made, Gorgo, the little daughter of Cleomenes,
only eight years old, saw by their looks that something was
wrong, and cried out, &ldquo;Go away, father; this stranger <!--
page 132--><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>will do you harm.&rdquo;&nbsp; Cleomenes took it as the
voice of an oracle, and left the stranger to himself.</p>
<p>He then went to Athens, and the Athenians, being Ionians
themselves, listened more willingly, and promised to aid their
brethren in freeing themselves.&nbsp; Together, the Athenians and
a large body of Ephesians, Milesians, and other Ionians, attacked
Sardis.&nbsp; The Persian satrap Artaphernes threw himself into
the citadel; but the town, which was built chiefly of
wicker-work, that the houses might not be easily thrown down by
earthquakes, caught fire, and was totally burnt.&nbsp; The
Athenians could not stay in the flaming streets, and had to give
back, and the whole Persian force of the province came up and
drove them out.&nbsp; Darius was furious when he heard of the
burning of Sardis, and, for fear he should forget his revenge,
ordered that a slave should mention the name of Athens every day
to him as he sat down to dinner.&nbsp; Histi&aelig;us, however,
succeeded in his plan, for Darius believed him when he said the
uproar could only have broken out in his absence, and let him go
home to try to put it down.</p>
<p>He was not very well received by Artaphernes, who was sure he
was at the bottom of the revolt.&nbsp; &ldquo;Aristagoras put on
the shoe,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but it was of your
stitching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aristagoras had been killed, and Histi&aelig;us, fleeing to
the Ionians, remained with them till they were entirely beaten,
and he surrendered to the Persians, by whom <!-- page 133--><a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>he was
crucified, while the Ionians were entirely crushed, and saw their
fairest children carried off to be slaves in the palace at
Susa.&nbsp; Darius had longed after Greek slaves ever since he
had seen a fine handsome girl walking along, upright, with a
pitcher of water on her head, the bridle of a horse she was
leading over her arm, and her hands busy with a distaff.&nbsp; He
did not know that such grand people are never found in enslaved,
oppressed countries, like his own, and he wanted to have them all
under his power, so he began to raise his forces from all parts
of his empire, for the conquest of what seemed to him the
insolent little cities of Greece, and Hippias, now an old man,
undertook to show him the way to Athens, and to betray his
country.&nbsp; The battle was between the East and
West&mdash;between a despot ruling mere slaves, and free,
thoughtful cities, full of evil indeed, and making many mistakes,
but brave and resolute, and really feeling for their hearths and
homes.</p>

Persian fleet, manned by Ph&oelig;nician sailors, and a huge
army, under the two satraps Datis and Artaphernes, were on the
opposite side of the &AElig;gean Sea, ready to overwhelm little
Attica first, and then all Greece.&nbsp; Nobody had yet stood
firm against those all-conquering Persians, and as they came from
island to island the inhabitants fled or submitted.&nbsp; Attica
was so small as to have only 9000 fighting men to meet this
host.&nbsp; They sent to ask the aid of the Spartans, but though
these would have fought bravely, an old rule forbade them to
march during the week before the full moon, and in this week
Athens might be utterly ruined.&nbsp; Nobody did come to their
help but 600 men from the very small state of Plat&aelig;a, and
this little army, not numbering 10,000, were encamped around the
temple of Hercules, looking down upon the bay of Marathon, where
lay the ships which had just landed at least 200,000 men of all
the Eastern nations, and among them many of the Greeks of Asia
<!-- page 135--><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>Minor.&nbsp; The hills slant back so as to make a sort
of horse-shoe round the bay, with about five miles of clear flat
ground between them and the sea, and on this open space lay the
Persians.</p>
<p>It was the rule among the Athenians that the heads of their
ten tribes should command by turns each for a day, but Aristides,
the best and most high-minded of all of them, persuaded the rest
to give up their turns to Miltiades, who was known to be the most
skilful captain.&nbsp; He drew up his men in a line as broad as
the whole front of the Persian army, though far less deep, and
made them all come rushing down at them with even step, but at a
run, shouting the war-cry, &ldquo;Io p&aelig;an!&nbsp; Io
p&aelig;an!&rdquo;&nbsp; In the middle, where the best men of the
Persians were, they stood too firm to be thus broken, but at the
sides they gave way, and ran back towards the sea, or over the
hills, and then Miltiades gave a signal to the two side
divisions&mdash;wings, as they were called&mdash;to close up
together, and crush the Persian centre.&nbsp; The enemy now
thought of nothing but reaching their ships and putting out to
sea, while the Athenians tried to seize their ships; Cynegyrus,
one brave Greek, caught hold of the prow of one ship, and when
the crew cut off his hand with an axe, he still clung with the
other, till that too was cut off, and he sank and was
drowned.&nbsp; The fleet still held many men, and the Athenians
saw that, instead of crossing back to Asia Minor, it was sailing
round the promontory of Sunium, as if to attack Athens.&nbsp; It
was even said that <!-- page 136--><a name="page136"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 136</span>a friend of Hippias had raised a
shield, glittering in the sun, as a signal that all the men were
away.&nbsp; However, Miltiades left Aristides, with his tribe of
1000 men, to guard the plain and bury the dead, and marched back
over the hills with the rest to guard their homes, that same
night; but the Persians must have been warned, or have changed
their mind, for they sailed away for Asia; and Hippias, who seems
to have been wounded in the battle, died at Lemnos.&nbsp; The
Spartans came up just as all was over, and greatly praised the
Athenians, for indeed it was the first time Greeks had beaten
Persians, and it was the battle above all others that saved
Europe from falling under the slavery of the East.&nbsp; The
fleet was caught by a storm as it crossed the &AElig;gean Sea
again.</p>
<p>All the Athenians who had been slain were buried under one
great mound, adorned with ten pillars bearing their names; the
Plat&aelig;ans had another honourable mound, and the Persians a
third.&nbsp; All the treasure that was taken in the camp and
ships was honourably brought to the city and divided.&nbsp; There
was only one exception, namely, one Kallias, who wore long hair
bound with a fillet, and was taken for a king by a poor Persian,
who fell on his knees before him, and showed him a well where was
a great deal of gold hidden.&nbsp; Kallias not only took the
gold, but killed the poor stranger, and his family were ever
after held as disgraced, and called by a nickname meaning,
&ldquo;Enriched by the Well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Plat&aelig;ans were rewarded by being made freemen <!--
page 137--><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>of Athens, as well as of their own city; and Miltiades,
while all his countrymen were full of joy and exultation, asked
of them a fleet of seventy ships, promising to bring them fame
and riches.&nbsp; With it he sailed for the island of Faros, that
which was specially famed for its white marble.&nbsp; He said he
meant to punish the Parians for having joined the Persians, but
it really was because of a quarrel of his own.&nbsp; He landed,
and required the Parians to pay him a hundred talents, and when
they refused he besieged the city, until a woman named Timo, who
was priestess at a temple of Ceres near the gates, promised to
tell him a way of taking the city if he would meet her at night
in the temple, where no man was allowed to enter.&nbsp; He came,
and leaped over the outer fence of the temple, but, brave as he
was in battle, terror at treading on forbidden and sacred ground
overpowered him, and, without seeing the priestess, he leaped
back again, fell on the other side, and severely injured his
thigh.&nbsp; The siege was given up, and he was carried back
helpless to Athens, where there was no mercy to failures, and he
was arraigned before the Areopagus assembly, by a man named
Xanthippus, for having wasted the money of the State and deceived
the people, and therefore being guilty of death.</p>
<p>It must have been a sad thing to see the great captain, who
had saved his country in that great battle only a year or two
before, lying on his couch, too ill to defend himself, while his
brother spoke for him, and <!-- page 138--><a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>appealed to
his former services.&nbsp; In consideration of these it was
decided not to condemn him to die, but he was, instead, to pay
fifty talents of silver, and before the sum could be raised, he
died of his hurts.&nbsp; It was said that his son Kim&ocirc;n put
himself into prison till the fine could be raised, so as to
release his father&rsquo;s corpse, which was buried with all
honour on the plain of Marathon, with a tomb recording his glory,
and not his fall.</p>
<p>The two chief citizens who were left were Aristides and
Themistocles, both very able men; but Aristides was perfectly
high-minded, unselfish, and upright, while Themistocles cared for
his own greatness more than anything else.&nbsp; Themistocles was
so clever that his tutor had said to him when he was a child,
&ldquo;Boy, thou wilt never be an ordinary person; thou wilt
either be a mighty blessing or a mighty curse to thy
country.&rdquo;&nbsp; When he grew up he used his powers of
leading the multitude for his own advantage, and that of his
party.&nbsp; &ldquo;The gods forbid,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that
I should sit on any tribunal where my friends should not have
more advantage than strangers.&rdquo;&nbsp; While, on the other
hand, Aristides was so impartial and single-hearted that he got
the name of Aristides the Just.&nbsp; He cared most for the
higher class, the <i>aristoi</i>, and thought they could govern
best, while Themistocles sought after the favour of the people;
and they both led the minds of the Athenians so completely while
they were speaking, that, after a meeting where they had both
made a speech, Aristides said, &ldquo;Athens will never be safe
till <!-- page 139--><a name="page139"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 139</span>Themistocles and I are both in
prison,&rdquo; meaning that either of them could easily make
himself tyrant.</p>
<p>However, Aristides, though of high family, was very poor, and
men said it was by the fault of his cousin Kallias, the
&ldquo;Enriched by the Well;&rdquo; and Themistocles contrived to
turn people&rsquo;s minds against him, so as to have him
ostracised.&nbsp; One day he met a man in the street, with a
shell in his hand, who asked him to write the name of Aristides
on it, as he could not write himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray,&rdquo;
said Aristides, &ldquo;what harm has this person done you, that
you wish to banish him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No harm at all,&rdquo; said the man; &ldquo;only I am
sick of always hearing him called the Just.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aristides had no more to say, but wrote his own name; and six
thousand shells having been counted up against him, he was
obliged to go into exile for ten years.</p>
<p>Cynegyrus, the man whose hands had been cut off in the bay of
Marathon, had a very famous brother named
&AElig;schylus&mdash;quite as brave a soldier, and a poet
besides.&nbsp; The Athenians had come to worshipping Bacchus, but
not in the horrid, mad, drunken manner of the first orgies.&nbsp;
They had songs and dances by persons with their heads wreathed in
vine and ivy leaves, and a goat was sacrificed in the
midst.&nbsp; The Greek word for a goat is <i>tragos</i>, and the
dances came to be called tragedies.&nbsp; Then came in the custom
of having poetical speeches in the midst of the dances, made in
the person of some old hero or god, and these <!-- page 140--><a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>always took
place in a curve in the side of a hill, so worked out by art that
the rock was cut into galleries, for half-circles of spectators
to sit one above the other, while the dancers and speakers were
on the flat space at the bottom.&nbsp; Thespis, whom Solon
reproved for falsehoods, was the first person who made the
dancers and singers, who were called the chorus, so answer one
another and the speakers that the tragedy became a play,
representing some great action of old.&nbsp; The actors had to
wear brazen masks and tall buskins, or no one could have well
seen or heard them.&nbsp; &AElig;schylus, when a little boy, was
set to watch the grapes in his father&rsquo;s vineyard.&nbsp; He
fell asleep, and dreamt that Bacchus appeared to him, and bade
him make his festivals noble with tragedies; and this he
certainly did, for the poetry he wrote for them is some of the
grandest that man ever sung, and shows us how these great Greeks
were longing and feeling after the truth, like blind men groping
in the dark.&nbsp; The custom was to have three grave plays or
tragedies on the same subject on three successive days, and then
to finish with a droll one, or comedy, as it was called, in
honour of the god Comus.&nbsp; There is one trilogy of
&AElig;schylus still preserved to us, where we have the death of
Agamemnon, the vengeance of Orestes, and his expiation when
pursued by the Furies, but the comedy belonging to them is
lost.</p>
<p>Almost all the greatest and best Greeks of this time believed
in part in the philosophy of Pythagoras, who had lived in the
former century, and taught that the <!-- page 141--><a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>whole
universe was one great divine musical instrument, as it were, in
which stars, sun, winds, and earth did their part, and that man
ought to join himself into the same sweet harmony.&nbsp; He
thought that if a man did ill his spirit went into some animal,
and had a fresh trial to purify it, but it does not seem as if
many others believed this notion.</p>

Athenians had not a long breathing-time.&nbsp; Darius, indeed,
died five years after the battle of Marathon; but his son Xerxes
was far more fiery and ambitious, and was no sooner on the throne
than he began to call together all the vast powers of the East,
not to crush Athens alone, but all the Greeks.&nbsp; He was five
years gathering them together, but in the spring of 480 he set
out from Sardis to march to the Hellespont, where he had a bridge
of ships chained together, made to enable his army to cross the
strait on foot.&nbsp; Xerxes was a hot-tempered man, not used to
resistance, and it was said that when a storm broke part of his
bridge he caused the waves to be scourged and fetters to be
thrown in, to show that he was going to bind it to his
will.&nbsp; He sat on a throne to watch his armies pass by.&nbsp;
It is said that there were two million six hundred thousand men,
of every speech and dress in Asia and Egypt, with all sorts of
weapons; and as the &ldquo;Great King&rdquo; watched the endless
number pass by, he burst <!-- page 143--><a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>into tears
to think how soon all this mighty host would be dead men!</p>
<p>Xerxes had a huge fleet besides, manned by Ph&oelig;nicians
and Greeks of Asia Minor, and this did not venture straight
across the &AElig;gean, because of his father&rsquo;s disaster,
but went creeping round the northern coast.&nbsp; Mount Athos,
standing out far and steep into the sea, stood in the way, and it
was dangerous to go round it; so Xerxes thought it would be an
undertaking worthy of him to have a canal dug across the neck
that joins the mountain to the land, and the Greeks declared that
he wrote a letter to the mountain god, bidding him not to put
rocks in the way of the workmen of the &ldquo;Great
King.&rdquo;&nbsp; Traces of this canal can still be found in the
ravine behind Mount Athos.</p>
<p>All the Greeks knew their danger now, and a council from every
city met at the Isthmus of Corinth to consider what was to be
done.&nbsp; All their ships, 271 in number, were gathered in a
bay on the north of the great island of Eub&oelig;a.&nbsp; There
the Spartan captain of the whole watched and waited, till beacons
from height to height announced that the Persians were coming,
and then he thought it safer to retreat within the Euripus, the
channel between the island and the mainland, which is so narrow
that a very few ships could stop the way of a whole fleet.&nbsp;
However, just as they were within shelter, a terrible storm
arose, which broke up and wrecked a great number of Persian
ships, though the number that were left still was far beyond that
of the <!-- page 144--><a name="page144"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 144</span>Greeks.&nbsp; On two days the Greeks
ventured out, and always gained the victory over such ships as
they encountered, but were so much damaged themselves, without
destroying anything like the whole fleet, that such fighting was
hopeless work.</p>
<p>In the meantime Xerxes, with his monstrous land army, was
marching on, and the only place where it seemed to the council at
the Isthmus that he could be met and stopped was at a place in
Thessaly, where the mountains of &OElig;ta rose up like a steep
wall, leaving no opening but towards the sea, where a narrow road
wound round the foot of the cliff, and between it and the sea was
a marsh that men and horses could never cross.&nbsp; The springs
that made this bog were hot, so that it was called
Thermopyl&aelig;, or the Hot Gates.</p>
<p>The council at the Isthmus determined to send an army to stop
the enemy there, if possible.&nbsp; There were 300 Spartans, and
various troops from other cities, all under the command of one of
the Spartan kings, Leonidas, who had married Gorgo, the girl
whose word had kept her father faithful.&nbsp; They built up a
stone wall in front of them, and waited for the enemy, and
by-and-by the Persians came, spreading over an immense space in
the rear, but in this narrow road only a few could fight at once,
so that numbers were of little use.&nbsp; Xerxes sent to desire
the Spartans to give up their arms.&nbsp; Leonidas only answered,
&ldquo;Come and take them.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Persian messenger
reported that the Greeks were sitting on the wall combing their
hair, while others were playing <!-- page 145--><a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>at warlike
games.&nbsp; Xerxes thought they were mad, but a traitor Spartan
whom he had in his camp said it was always the fashion of his
countrymen before any very perilous battle.&nbsp; Xerxes made so
sure of victory over such a handful of men, that he bade his
captains bring them all alive to him; but day after day his best
troops fell beaten back from the wall, and hardly a Greek was
slain.</p>

</a></p>
<p>But, alas! there was a mountain path through the chestnut
woods above.&nbsp; Leonidas had put a guard of <!-- page 146--><a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>Phocian
soldiers to watch it, and the Persians did not know of it till a
wretch, for the sake of reward, came and offered to show them the
way, so that they might fall on the defenders of the pass from
behind.&nbsp; In the stillness of the early dawn, the Phocians
heard the trampling of a multitude on the dry chestnut
leaves.&nbsp; They stood to arms, but as soon as the Persians
shot their arrows at them they fled away and left the path
open.&nbsp; Soon it was known in the camp that the foe were on
the hills above.&nbsp; There was still time to retreat, and
Leonidas sent off all the allies to save their lives; but he
himself and his 300 Spartans, with 700 Thespians, would not leave
their post, meaning to sell their lives as dearly as
possible.&nbsp; The Delphic oracle had said that either Sparta or
a king of Sparta must perish, and he was ready to give himself
for his country.&nbsp; Two young cousins of the line of Hercules
he tried to save, by telling them to bear his messages home; but
one answered that he had come to fight, not carry letters, and
the other that they would fight first, and then take home the
news.&nbsp; Two more Spartans, whose eyes were diseased, were at
the hot baths near.&nbsp; One went back with the allies, the
other caused his Helot to lead him to the camp, where, in the
evening, all made ready to die, and Leonidas sat down to his last
meal, telling his friends that on the morrow they should sup with
Pluto.&nbsp; One of these Thespians had answered, when he was
told that the Persian arrows came so thickly as to hide the sky,
&ldquo;So much the better; we shall fight in the
shade.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 147--><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>The Persians were by this time so much afraid of these
brave men that they could only be driven against them by
whips.&nbsp; Leonidas and his thousand burst out on them beyond
the wall, and there fought the whole day, till everyone of them
was slain, but with heaps upon heaps of dead Persians round them,
so that, when Xerxes looked at the spot, he asked in horror
whether all the Greeks were like these, and how many more
Spartans there were.&nbsp; Like a barbarian, he had
Leonidas&rsquo; body hung on a cross; but in after times the
brave king&rsquo;s bones were buried on the spot, and a mound
raised over the other warriors, with the words
engraven&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Go, passer-by, at Sparta tell,<br />
Obedient to her law, we fell.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was nothing now between the Persians and the temple at
Delphi.&nbsp; The priests asked the oracle if they should bury
the treasures.&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; the answer was; &ldquo;the
god will protect his own.&rdquo;&nbsp; And just as a party of
Persians were climbing up the heights to the magnificent temple
there was a tremendous storm; rocks, struck by lightning, rolled
down, and the Persians fled in dismay; but it is said Xerxes sent
one man to insult the heathen god, and that he was a Jew, and
therefore had no fears, and came back safe.</p>
<p>Now that Thermopyl&aelig; was lost, there was no place fit to
guard short of the Isthmus of Corinth, and the council decided to
build a wall across that, and defend it, so as to save the
Peloponnesus.&nbsp; This left Attica outside, and the Athenians
held anxious council what <!-- page 148--><a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>was to
become of them.&nbsp; Before the way to Delphi was stopped, they
had asked the oracle what they were to do, and the answer had
been, &ldquo;Pallas had prayed for her city, but it was doomed;
yet a wooden wall should save her people, and at Salamis should
women be made childless, at seed-time or harvest.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>Themistocles said the wooden walls meant the ships, and that
the Athenians were all to sail away and leave the city.&nbsp;
Others would have it that the wooden walls were the old thorn
fence of the Acropolis, and these, <!-- page 149--><a
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>being
mostly old people, chose to stay, while all the rest went away;
and while the wives and children were kindly sheltered by their
friends in the Peloponnesus, the men all joined the fleet, which
lay off Salamis, and was now 366 in number.&nbsp; The Persians
overran the whole country, overcame the few who held out the
Acropolis, and set Athens on fire.&nbsp; All the hope of Greece
was now in the fleet, which lay in the strait between Attica and
the isle of Salamis.&nbsp; Eurybiades, the Spartan commander,
still wanted not to fight, but Themistocles was resolved on the
battle.&nbsp; Eurybiades did all he could to silence him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Those who begin a race before the signal are
scourged,&rdquo; said the Spartan.&nbsp; &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said
Themistocles; &ldquo;but the laggards never win a
crown.&rdquo;&nbsp; Eurybiades raised his leading staff as if to
give him a blow.&nbsp; &ldquo;Strike, but hear me,&rdquo; said
Themistocles; and then he showed such good reason for there
meeting the battle that Eurybiades gave way.&nbsp; Six days later
the Persian fleet, in all its grandeur, came up, and Xerxes
caused his throne to be set on Mount &AElig;galeos, above the
strait, that he might see the battle.&nbsp; The doubts of the
Peloponnesians revived.&nbsp; They wanted to sail away and guard
their own shores, but Themistocles was so resolved that they
should fight that he sent a slave with a message to Xerxes,
pretending to be a traitor, and advising him to send ships to
stop up the other end of the strait, to cut off their
retreat.&nbsp; This was done, to the horror of honest Aristides,
who, still exiled, was in &AElig;gina, watching what to <!-- page
150--><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>do
for his countrymen.&nbsp; In a little boat he made his way at
night to the ship where council was being held, and begged that
Themistocles might be called out.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us be rivals
still,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but let our strife be which can
serve our country best.&nbsp; I come to say that your retreat is
cut off.&nbsp; We are surrounded, and must fight.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Themistocles said it was the best thing that could happen, and
led him into the council with his tidings.</p>
<p>They did fight.&nbsp; Ship was dashed against ship as fast as
oars could bring them, their pointed beaks bearing one another
down.&nbsp; The women who were made childless were Persian
women.&nbsp; Two hundred Persian ships were sunk, and only forty
Greek ones; an immense number were taken; and Xerxes, from his
throne, saw such utter ruin of all his hopes and plans, that he
gave up all thought of anything but getting his land army back to
the Hellespont as fast as possible, for his fleet was gone!</p>

being thus beaten by sea, and having learnt what Greeks were by
land, Xerxes himself, with a broken, sick, and distressed army,
went back to Sardis; but he left a satrap named Mardonius behind
him, with his best troops, in Thessaly, to see whether anything
could still be done for his cause.&nbsp; He did try whether the
Athenians could be persuaded to desert the other Greeks, and
become allies of Persia, but they made a noble
answer&mdash;&ldquo;So long as the sun held his course, the
Athenians would never be friends to Xerxes.&nbsp; Great as might
be his power, Athens trusted to the aid of the gods and heroes,
whose temple he had burnt.&rdquo;</p>

</a>After this answer, Mardonius marched again into Attica, and
took possession of it; but as the Athenians were now all safe in
Salamis, or among their friends, he could not do them much harm;
and while he was finishing the ruin he had begun ten months
before, the Spartans had raised their army, under the command of
<!-- page 152--><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>their king, Pausanias, nephew to Leonidas, and all the
best soldiers from the other Greek cities.&nbsp; They came up
with the Persians near the city of Plat&aelig;a.&nbsp; Though a
Spartan, Pausanias had rather not have fought; but when at last
the battle began, it was a grand victory, and was gained in a
wonderfully short time.&nbsp; The Spartans killed Mardonius, and
put the best Persian troops, called the Immortals, to flight; and
the Athenians, under Aristides, fought with the Thebans, who had
joined the Persian army.&nbsp; The whole Persian camp was
sacked.&nbsp; The Helots were sent to collect the spoil, and put
it all together.&nbsp; They stole a good deal of the gold, which
they took for brass, and sold it as such.&nbsp; Waggon-loads of
silver and gold vessels were to be seen; collars, bracelets, and
rich armour; and the manger of Xerxes&rsquo; horses, which he had
left behind, and which was of finely-worked brass.&nbsp;
Pausanias bade the slaves of Mardonius to prepare such a feast as
their master was used to, and then called his friends to see how
useless were all the carpets, cushions, curtains, gold and
silver, and the dainties upon them, and how absurd it was to set
out on a conquering expedition thus encumbered.</p>
<p>A tenth part of the spoil was set apart for Apollo, and formed
into a golden tripod, supported by a brazen <!-- page 153--><a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>serpent
with three heads.&nbsp; A great statue of Jupiter was sent to
Olympia, the pedestal adorned with the names of all the cities
which had sent men to the battle, and such another of Neptune was
set up on the Isthmus; while a temple to Athene, adorned with
pictures of the battle, was built on the spot near
Plat&aelig;a.&nbsp; Pausanias received a sample of all that was
best of the spoil.&nbsp; Among the dead was found that one
Spartan who had missed Thermopyl&aelig;.&nbsp; He had been
miserable ever since, and only longed to die in battle, as now he
had done.&nbsp; The Plat&aelig;ans were to be respected by all
the other states of Greece, so long as they yearly performed <!--
page 154--><a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>funeral rites in honour of the brave men whose tombs
were left in their charge.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p153.jpg">
<img alt=
"Tombs at Plat&aelig;a"
title=
"Tombs at Plat&aelig;a"
src="images/p153.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>On the same day as the battle of Plat&aelig;a was fought,
another great battle was fought at Mykale, near Miletus, by the
Ionian Greeks of Asia, assisted by Athenians and Spartans.&nbsp;
It set Miletus free from the Persians, and was the first step
backwards of their great power.&nbsp; The Athenian fleet also
gained back the Chersonesus, and brought home the chains that had
fastened together the bridge of boats, to be dedicated in the
temples of their own gods.</p>
<p>The Athenians were all coming home rejoicing.&nbsp; Even the
very week after Xerxes had burnt the Acropolis, the sacred olive
which Pallas Athene was said to have given them had shot out a
long branch from the stump, and now it was growing well, to their
great joy and encouragement.&nbsp; Everyone began building up his
own house; and Themistocles, Aristides, and the other statesmen
prepared to build strong walls round the city, though the
Spartans sent messengers to persuade them that it was of no use
to have any fortified cities outside the Peloponnesus; but they
knew this was only because the Spartans wanted to be masters of
Greece, and would not attend to them.&nbsp; Athens stood about
three miles from the coast, and in the port there had hitherto
been a village called Pir&aelig;us, and Themistocles persuaded
the citizens to make this as strong as possible, with a wall of
solid stone round it.&nbsp; These were grand days at
Athens.&nbsp; They had noble architects and <!-- page 155--><a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>sculptors;
and &AElig;schylus was writing the grandest of his
tragedies&mdash;especially one about the despair of the Persian
women&mdash;but only fragments of most of them have come down to
our time.</p>
<p>In 375 Aristides died, greatly honoured, though he was so poor
that he did not leave enough to pay his funeral expenses; but a
monument was raised to him by the State, and there is only one
Athenian name as pure and noble as his.</p>
<p>The two other men who shared with him the honours of the
defeat of the Persians met with very different fates, and by
their own fault.&nbsp; When Pausanias went back to Sparta, he
found his life there too stern and full of restraint, after what
he had been used to in his campaign.&nbsp; He tried to break down
the power of the Ephors, and obtain something more like royalty
for the kings, and this he hoped to do by the help of
Persia.&nbsp; He used to meet the messenger of this traitorous
correspondence in the temple of Neptune, in the promontory of
T&aelig;narus.&nbsp; Some of the Ephors were warned, hid
themselves there, and heard his treason from his own lips.&nbsp;
They sent to arrest him as soon as he came back to Sparta; but he
took refuge in the temple of Pallas, whence he could not be
dragged.&nbsp; However, the Spartans were determined to have
justice on him.&nbsp; They walled up the temple, so that he could
neither escape nor have food brought to him; indeed it is said
that, in horror at his treason, his mother brought the first
stone.&nbsp; When he was at the point of <!-- page 156--><a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>death he
was taken out, that the sanctuary might not be polluted, and he
died just as he was carried out.&nbsp; The Spartans buried him
close to the temple, and gave Pallas two statues of him, to make
up for the suppliant she had lost, but they were always
reproached for the sacrilege.</p>
<p>Themistocles was a friend of Pausanias, and was suspected of
being mixed up in his plots.&nbsp; He was obliged to flee the
country, and went to Epirus, where he came to the house of King
Admetus, where the queen, Phthia, received him, and told him how
to win her husband&rsquo;s protection, namely, by sitting down on
the hearth by the altar to the household gods, and holding her
little son in his arms.</p>
<p>When Admetus came in, Themistocles entreated him to have pity
on his defenceless state.&nbsp; The king raised him up and
promised his protection, and kept his word.&nbsp; Themistocles
was taken by two guides safely across the mountains to Pydna,
where he found a merchant ship about to sail for Asia.&nbsp; A
storm drove it to the island of Naxos, which was besieged by an
Athenian fleet; and Themistocles must have fallen into the hands
of his fellow-citizens if he had landed, but he told the master
of the ship that it would be the ruin of all alike if he were
found in the vessel, and promised a large reward if he
escaped.&nbsp; So the crew consented to beat about a whole day
and night, and in the morning landed safely near Ephesus.&nbsp;
He kept his word to the captain; for indeed he was very rich,
having taken bribes, while <!-- page 157--><a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>Aristides
remained in honourable poverty.&nbsp; He went to Susa, where
Xerxes was dead; but the Persians had fancied his message before
the battle of Salamis was really meant to serve them, and that he
was suffering for his attachment to them, so the new king,
Artaxerxes, the &ldquo;Long-armed,&rdquo; who had a great esteem
for his cleverness, was greatly delighted, offered up a sacrifice
in his joy, and three times cried out in his sleep, &ldquo;I have
got Themistocles the Athenian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Themistocles had asked to wait a year before seeing the king,
that he might have time to learn the language.&nbsp; When he
came, he put forward such schemes for conquering Greece that
Artaxerxes was delighted, and gave him a Persian wife, and large
estates on the banks of the M&aelig;ander, where he spent the
rest of his life, very rich, but despised by all honest
Greeks.</p>
<p>All the history of the war with Xerxes was written by
Herodotus, a Greek of Caria, who travelled about to study the
manners, customs, and histories of different nations, and
recorded them in the most lively and spirited manner, so that he
is often called the father of history.</p>
<p>&AElig;schylus went on gaining prizes for his tragedies, till
468, when, after being thirteen times first, he was excelled by
another Athenian named Sophocles, and was so much vexed that he
withdrew to the Greek colonies in Sicily.&nbsp; It is not clear
whether he ever came back to Athens for a time, but he certainly
died in <!-- page 158--><a name="page158"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 158</span>Sicily, and in an extraordinary
way.&nbsp; He was asleep on the sea-shore, when an eagle flew
above him with a tortoise in its claws.&nbsp; It is the custom of
eagles to break the shells of these creatures by letting them
fall on rocks from a great height.&nbsp; The bird took
&AElig;schylus&rsquo; bald head for a stone, threw down the
tortoise, broke his skull, and killed him!</p>
<p>Sophocles did not write such grand lines, yearning for the
truth, as &AElig;schylus, but his plays, of Ajax&rsquo; madness,
and especially of Antigone&rsquo;s self-devotion, were more
touching, and full of human feeling; and Euripides, who was a
little younger, wrote plays more like those of later times, with
more of story in them, and more characters, especially of
women.&nbsp; He even wrote one in which he represented Helen as
never having been unfaithful at all; Venus only made up a
cloud-image to be run away with by Paris, and Helen was carried
away and hidden in Egypt, where Menelaus found her, and took her
home.&nbsp; The works of these three great men have always been
models.&nbsp; The Greeks knew their plays by heart almost as
perfectly as the <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i>, and used to
quote lines wherever they applied.</p>

and Sparta were now quite the greatest powers in Greece.&nbsp; No
other state had dared to make head against the Persians, and all
the lesser cities, and the isles and colonies, were anxious to
obtain the help and friendship of one or other as their
allies.&nbsp; The two states were always rivals, and never made
common cause, except when the Persian enemy was before
them.&nbsp; In the year 464 there was a terrible earthquake in
Laconia, which left only five houses standing in Sparta, and
buried great numbers in the ruins.&nbsp; The youths, who were all
together in one building exercising themselves, were almost all
killed by its fall; and the disaster would have been worse if the
king, Archidamas, had not caused the trumpet to be blown, as if
to call the people to arms, just outside the city.&nbsp; This
brought all the men in order together just in time, for the
Helots were rising against them, and, if they had found them
groping each in the ruins of his house, might have killed them
one by one; whereas, finding them up and armed, the slaves saw it
was in vain, and dispersed.</p>
<p><!-- page 160--><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>The Messenians, who had never forgotten Aristodemus,
hoped to free themselves again.&nbsp; A great many of the Helots
joined them, and they made their fortified hill of Ithome very
strong.&nbsp; The Spartans called on the Athenians to help them
to put down the insurrection.&nbsp; The three greatest men in
Athens were Pericles, the son of that Xanthippus who had
impeached Miltiades; Kim&ocirc;n, the son of Miltiades himself;
and Ephialtes, a great orator, who was thought to be as upright
as Aristides the Just.&nbsp; When the request from Sparta came,
Ephialtes was against helping the rival of Athens; but
Kim&ocirc;n, who had friends in Laconia, declared that it would
be unbecoming in Athens to let Greece be crippled in one of her
two legs, or to lose her own yoke-fellow.&nbsp; He prevailed, and
was sent with an army to help in the siege of Ithome; but it was
such a tardy siege that the Spartans fancied that the Athenians
had an understanding with the Messenians, and desired them to go
home again, thus, of course, affronting them exceedingly.</p>
<p>Two years after, Kim&ocirc;n was ostracised; but soon after
the Spartans affronted the Athenians, by placing a troop of men
at Tanagra, on the borders of Attica.&nbsp; The Athenians went
out to attack them, and Kim&ocirc;n sent to entreat permission to
fight among his tribe, but he was not trusted, and was
forbidden.&nbsp; He sent his armour to his friends&mdash;a
hundred in number&mdash;and bade them maintain his honour.&nbsp;
They were all killed, fighting bravely, and the victory was with
the Spartans.&nbsp; Soon <!-- page 161--><a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>after, the
virtuous Ephialtes was stabbed by some unknown person, and
Pericles, feeling that good men could not be spared, moved that
Kim&ocirc;n should be called home again.&nbsp; Kim&ocirc;n was
much loved; he was tall and handsome, with curly hair and beard;
and he was open-handed, leaving his orchards and gardens free to
all, and keeping a table for every chance guest.&nbsp; Yet he
much admired the Spartans and their discipline, and he contrived
to bring about a five-years&rsquo; truce between the two great
powers.&nbsp; The greatest benefit he gave his people was the
building of the Long Walls, which joined Athens and the
Pir&aelig;us together, so that the city could never be cut off
from the harbour.&nbsp; Kim&ocirc;n began them at his own
expense, and Pericles persuaded the Athenians to go on with them,
when their founder had been sent on an expedition to the isle of
Cyprus, which was rising against the Persians.&nbsp; There
Kim&ocirc;n fell sick and died, but his fleet, immediately after,
won a grand victory over the Ph&oelig;nician and Cilician fleets,
in the Persian service.</p>

<p>However, some hot-headed young Athenians were beaten at
Coronea by the B&oelig;otians, who were Spartan allies, and a
good many small losses befel them by land, till they made another
peace for thirty years in 445.&nbsp; There was nobody then in
Athens, or Greece either, equal to Pericles, who was managing all
affairs in his own city with great wisdom, and making it most
beautiful with public buildings.&nbsp; On the rock of the
Acropolis stood the Parthenon, the temple of the virgin <!-- page
162--><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>goddess Pallas Athene, which was adorned with a
portico, the remains of which still stand up gloriously against
the blue Grecian sky.&nbsp; The bas-relief carvings on the
pediments, representing the fight between the Centaurs and
Lapith&aelig;, are now in the British Museum; and though the
statue itself is gone, still seals and gems remain, made to
imitate it, and showing the perfect beauty of the ivory and gold
statue of Athene herself, which was carved by the great sculptor
Phidias, and placed within the temple.&nbsp; When there was a
question whether this figure should be made of marble or of
ivory, and Phidias recommended marble as the <!-- page 163--><a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>cheapest,
the whole assembly of Athenians voted for ivory.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>A beautiful fortification called the Propyl&aelig;a guarded
the west side of the Acropolis, where only there was no
precipice; and there were other splendid buildings&mdash;a new
open theatre, for the acting of those unrivalled tragedies of the
three Athenian poets, and of others which have been lost; a
Museum, which did not then mean a collection of curiosities, but
a place where the youth might study all the arts sacred to the
Muses; a Lyceum for their exercises, and schools for the <!--
page 164--><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>philosophers.&nbsp; These schools were generally
colonnades of pillars supporting roofs to give shelter from the
sun, and under one of these taught the greatest, wisest, and best
of all truth-seekers, namely, Socrates.</p>
<p>Though the houses at Athens stood irregularly on their steep
hill, there was no place in the world equal to it for beauty in
its buildings, its sculptures, and its carvings, and, it is also
said, in its paintings; but none of these have come down to our
times.&nbsp; Everything belonging to the Athenians was at this
time full of simple, manly grace and beauty, and in both body and
mind they were trying to work up to the greatest perfection they
could devise, without any aid outside themselves to help
them.</p>
<p>But they had come to the very crown of their glory.&nbsp; When
a war arose between the Corinthians and the Corcyrans, who
inhabited the isle now called Corfu, the Corcyrans asked to be
made allies of Athens, and a fleet was sent to help them; and as
the Corinthians held with Sparta, this brought on a great war
between Athens and Sparta, which was called the Peloponnesian
war, and lasted thirty years.&nbsp; It was really to decide which
of the two great cities should be chief, and both were equally
determined.</p>
<p>As Attica had borders open to the enemy, Pericles advised all
the people in the country to move into the town.&nbsp; They sent
their flocks into the isle of Eub&oelig;a, brought their other
goods with them, and left their beautiful farms and gardens to be
ravaged by the <!-- page 165--><a name="page165"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 165</span>enemy; while the crowd found
dwellings in a place under the west side of the Acropolis rock,
which had hitherto been left empty, because an oracle declared it
&ldquo;better untrodden.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such numbers coming within
the walls could not be healthy, and a deadly plague began to
prevail, which did Athens as much harm as the war.&nbsp; In the
meantime, Pericles, who was always cautious, persuaded the people
to be patient, and not to risk battles by land, where the
Spartans fought as well as they did, whereas nobody was their
equal by sea; and as their fleet and all their many isles could
save them from hunger, they could wear out their enemies, and be
fresh themselves; but it was hard to have plague within and
Spartans wasting their homes and fields without.&nbsp; Brave
little Plat&aelig;a, too, was closely besieged.&nbsp; All the
useless persons had been sent to Athens, and there were only 400
Plat&aelig;an and 80 Athenian men in it, and 110 women to wait on
them; and the Spartans blockaded these, and tried to starve them
out, until, after more than a year of famine, 220 of them
scrambled over the walls on a dark, wet night, cut their way
through the Spartan camp, and safely reached Athens.&nbsp; The
other 200 had thought the attempt so desperate, that they sent in
the morning to beg leave to bury the corpses of their comrades;
but they then heard that only one man had fallen.&nbsp; They held
out a few months longer, and then were all put to death, while
the women were all made slaves.&nbsp; The children and the 220
were all made one with the Athenians.</p>
<p><!-- page 166--><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
166</span>Athens was in a piteous state from the sickness, which
had cut off hosts of people of all ranks.&nbsp; It lasted seven
or nine days in each, and seems to have been a malignant
fever.&nbsp; Pericles lost his eldest son, his sister, and almost
all his dearest friends in it; but still he went about calm,
grave, and resolute, keeping up the hopes and patience of the
Athenians.&nbsp; Then his youngest and last son died of the same
sickness, and when the time came for placing the funeral garland
on his head, Pericles broke down, and wept and sobbed
aloud.&nbsp; Shortly after, he fell sick himself, and lingered
much longer than was usual with sufferers from the plague.&nbsp;
Once, when his friends came in, he showed them a charm which the
women had hung round his neck, and, smiling, asked them whether
his enduring such folly did not show that he must be very ill
indeed.&nbsp; Soon after, when he was sinking away, and they
thought him insensible, they began to talk of the noble deeds he
had done, his speeches, his wisdom and learning, and his
buildings: &ldquo;he had found Athens of brick,&rdquo; they said,
&ldquo;and had left her of marble.&rdquo;&nbsp; Suddenly the sick
man raised himself in his bed, and said, &ldquo;I wonder you
praise these things in me.&nbsp; They were as much owing to
fortune as to anything else; and yet you leave out what is my
special honour, namely, that I never caused any fellow-citizen to
put on mourning.&rdquo;&nbsp; So died this great man, in 429, the
third year of the Peloponnesian war.</p>

<h2>CHAP. XX.&mdash;THE EXPEDITION TO SICILY.&nbsp; <span

<p>
<img class='dc' alt='T' title='T' src='images/dct.jpg' />he
Peloponnesian war went on much in the same way for some years
after the death of Pericles.&nbsp; There was no such great man
left in Athens.&nbsp; Socrates, the wise and deep-thinking
philosopher, did not attend to state affairs more than was his
duty as a citizen; and the leading man for some years was
Nikias.&nbsp; He was an honest, upright man, but not clever, and
afraid of everything new, so that he was not the person to help
in time of strange dangers.</p>
<p>There was a youth growing up, however, of great ability.&nbsp;
His name was Alkibiades.&nbsp; He was of high and noble family,
but he had lost his parents very young, and Pericles had been his
guardian, taking great care of his property, so that he was
exceedingly rich.&nbsp; He was very beautiful in person, and that
was thought of greatly at Athens, though he was laughed at for
the pains he took to show off his beauty, and for carrying out to
battle a shield inlaid with gold and ivory, representing Cupid
hurling Jupiter&rsquo;s thunderbolts.&nbsp; His will <!-- page
168--><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>was so determined, that, when he was a little boy at
play in the street, and saw a waggon coming which would have
spoiled his arrangements, he laid himself down before the wheels
to stop it.&nbsp; He learnt easily, and, when he was with
Socrates, would talk as well and wisely as any philosopher of
them all; and Socrates really seems to have loved the bright,
beautiful youth even more than his two graver and worthier
pupils, Plato and Xenophon, perhaps because in one of
Alkibiades&rsquo; first battles, at Delium, he had been very
badly <!-- page 169--><a name="page169"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 169</span>wounded, and Socrates had carried
him safely out of the battle on his broad shoulders.&nbsp;
Socrates was very strong, but one of the ugliest of men, and the
Athenians were amused at the contrast between master and
pupil.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p168.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>But nobody could help loving Alkibiades in these early years,
and he was a sort of spoiled child of the people.&nbsp; He won
three crowns in the chariot races at the Olympic games, and
feasted and made presents to his fellow-citizens afterwards, and
he was always doing some strange thing in order to make a
sensation.&nbsp; The first day that he was old enough to be
admitted to the public assembly, while he was being greeted
there, he let loose a tame quail, which he carried about under
his cloak, and no business could be done till it had been
caught.&nbsp; Another time he came very late, with a garland on
his head, and desired to have the sitting put off because he had
a feast at his house; and the grave archons actually granted his
request.&nbsp; But the strangest thing he did was to cut off the
tail of his beautiful dog, that, as he said, the Athenians might
have something to talk about.&nbsp; In truth he made everything
give way to his freaks and self-will; and he was a harsh and
unkind husband, and insolent to his father-in-law; and, as time
went on, he offended a great many persons by his pride and
rudeness and selfishness, so that his brilliancy did little
good.</p>
<p>There were Greek colonies in Sicily, but these were mostly in
the interest of Sparta.&nbsp; There had been some fighting there
in the earlier years of the war, and Alkibiades was very anxious
to lead another expedition <!-- page 170--><a
name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>thither.&nbsp; Nikias thought this imprudent, and
argued much against it; but the effect of his arguments was that
the Athenians chose to join him in the command of it with
Alkibiades, much against his will, for he was elderly, and out of
health, and, of all men in Athens, he most disliked and
distrusted Alkibiades.</p>
<p>Just as the fleet for Sicily was nearly ready, all the busts
of Mercury which stood as mile-stones on the roads in Attica were
found broken and defaced; and the enemies of Alkibiades declared
that it was done in one of his drunken frolics.&nbsp; Such a
thing, done to the figure of a god was not mere mischief, but
sacrilege, and there was to be a great inquiry into it.&nbsp;
Alkibiades wanted much to have the trial over before he sailed,
that he might clear himself of the suspicion; and, indeed, it
seems certain that whatever follies he might commit when he had
nothing to do, he had then far too much to think of to be likely
to bring himself into trouble by such a wanton outrage.&nbsp; But
the Athenians chose to put off the inquiry till he was gone, and
the fleet set sail&mdash;the largest that had ever gone from the
Pir&aelig;us&mdash;with sound of trumpet, libations poured into
the sea from gold and silver bowls, songs and solemn prayers, as
the 100 war galleys rowed out of the harbour in one long
column.&nbsp; At Corcyra the fleet halted to meet their allies,
who raised the number of ships to 154, containing 5000
heavily-armed men, with whom they made sail for Rhegium, the
Italian foreland nearest to Sicily, whence they sent to make
inquiries.&nbsp; They found more of the <!-- page 171--><a
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>Greek
cities were against them than they had expected, and their
friends were weaker.&nbsp; Nikias wanted merely to sail round the
island, and show the power of Athens, and then go home
again.&nbsp; Lamachus, another general, wanted to make a bold
attack on Syracuse at once; and Alkibiades had a middle plan,
namely, to try to gain the lesser towns by force or friendship,
and to stir up the native Sicels to revolt.&nbsp; This plan was
accepted, and was going on well&mdash;for Alkibiades could always
talk anyone over, especially strangers, to whom his gracefulness
and brilliancy were new&mdash;when orders came from Athens that
he and his friends were to be at once sent home from the army, to
answer for the mischief done to the busts, and for many other
crimes of sacrilege, which were supposed to be part of a deep
plot for upsetting the laws of Solon, and making himself the
tyrant of Athens.</p>
<p>This was, of course, the work of his enemies, and the very
thing he had feared.&nbsp; His friends wrote to him that the
people were so furious against him that he had no chance of a
fair trial, and he therefore escaped on the way home, when, on
his failing to arrive, he was solemnly cursed, and condemned to
death.&nbsp; He took refuge in Sparta, where, fine gentleman as
he was, he followed the rough, hardy Spartan manners to
perfection, appeared to relish the black broth, and spoke the
Doric Greek of Laconia, as it was said, more perfectly than the
Spartans themselves.&nbsp; Unlike Aristides, and like the worse
sort of exiles, he tried to get his revenge <!-- page 172--><a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>by
persuading the allies of Athens in Asia Minor to revolt; and when
the Spartans showed distrust of him, he took refuge with the
Persian satrap Tissaphernes.</p>
<p>In the meantime, after he had left Sicily, Nikias was so
cautious that the Syracusans thought him cowardly, and provoked a
battle with him close to their own walls.&nbsp; He defeated them,
besieged their city, and had almost taken it, when a Spartan and
Corinthian fleet, headed by Gylippus, came out, forced their way
through the Athenians, and brought relief to the city.&nbsp; More
reinforcements came out to Athens, and there was a great
sea-fight in front of the harbour at Syracuse, which ended in the
total and miserable defeat of the Athenians, so that the army was
obliged to retreat from Syracuse, and give up the siege.&nbsp;
They had no food, nor any means of getting home, and all they
could do was to make their way back into the part of the island
that was friendly to them.&nbsp; Gylippus and the Syracusans
tried to block their way, but old Nikias showed himself firm and
undaunted in the face of misfortune, and they forced their way on
for three or four days, in great suffering from hunger and
thirst, till at last they were all hemmed into a small hollow
valley, shut in by rocks, where the Syracusans shot them down as
they came to drink at the stream, so thirsty that they seemed not
to care to die so long as they could drink.&nbsp; Upon this,
Nikias thought it best to offer to lay down his arms and
surrender.&nbsp; All the remnant of the army were enclosed in a
great quarry at Epipol&aelig;, the sides of which were 100 <!--
page 173--><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>feet high, and fed on a scanty allowance of bread and
water, while the victors considered what was to be done with
them, for in these heathen times there was no law of mercy for a
captive, however bravely he might have fought.&nbsp; Gylippus
wanted to save Nikias, for the pleasure of showing off so noble a
prisoner at Sparta; but some of the Syracusans, who had been on
the point of betraying their city to him, were afraid that their
treason would be known, and urged that he should be put to death
with his fellow-general; and the brave, honest, upright old man
was therefore slain with his companion Demosthenes.</p>
<p>For seventy days the rest remained in the dismal quarry,
scorched by the sun, half-starved, and rapidly dying off, until
they were publicly sold as slaves, when many of the Athenians
gained the favour of their masters by entertaining them by
repeating the poetry of their tragedians, especially of
Euripides, whose works had not yet been acted in Sicily.&nbsp;
Some actually thus gained their freedom from their masters, and
could return to Athens to thank the poet whose verses, stored in
their memory, had been their ransom.</p>
<p>All the history of the Peloponnesian war is written by
Thukydides, himself a brave Athenian soldier and statesman, who
had a great share in all the affairs of the time, and well knew
all the men whom he describes.</p>

<h2>CHAP. XXI.&mdash;THE SHORE OF THE GOAT&rsquo;S RIVER.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 406&ndash;402.</h2>
<p>
<img class='dc' alt='S' title='S' src='images/dcs.jpg' />till the
war went on, the Athenians holding out steadily, but the Spartans
beginning to care more for leadership than for Greece, and so
making league with the Persians.&nbsp; Alkibiades was forgiven
and called back again after a time, and he gained numerous towns
and islands back again for the Athenians, so that he sailed into
the Pir&aelig;us with a fleet, made up by his own ships and
prizes to full two hundred sail, all decked with purple, gold,
and silver, and doubling what had been lost in the unhappy
Sicilian enterprise; but his friends were sorry that it was what
they called an unlucky day&mdash;namely, that on which every year
the statue of Pallas Athene was stripped of its ornaments to be
dusted, washed, and repaired, and on which her worshippers always
avoided beginning anything or doing any business.</p>
<p>A very able man named Lysander, of the royal line, though not
a king, had come into command at Sparta, and he had a sea-fight
at Notium, just opposite to <!-- page 175--><a
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>Ephesus,
with the Athenians, and gained no very great advantage, but
enough to make the discontent and distrust always felt for
Alkibiades break out again, so that he was removed from the
command and sailed away to the Chersonese, where in the time of
his exile he had built himself a sort of little castle looking
out on the strait.</p>
<p>Konon was the name of the next commander of the fleet, which
consisted of 110 ships, with which he met the Spartan
Kallikratidas with only fifty, near the three little islets
called Arginus&aelig;, near Malea.&nbsp; The numbers were so
unequal that the Spartan was advised not to fight, but he
answered that &ldquo;his death would not hurt Sparta, but
dishonour would hurt him.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Athenians gained a
complete victory, Kallikratidas was killed, and the whole Spartan
fleet broken up; but the Athenian fleet lost a great many men by
a violent storm, which hindered the vessels from coming to the
aid of those which had been disabled, and which therefore sunk in
the tempest.</p>
<p>The relations of the men who had been drowned called for a
trial of the commanders for neglecting to save the lives of their
fellow-citizens, and there was such a bad spirit of party feeling
in Athens at the time that they were actually condemned to death,
all except Konon, though happily they were out of reach, and
their sentence could not be executed.&nbsp; Lysander was, in the
meantime, hard at work to collect a fresh fleet from the Spartan
allies and to build new ships, for which he <!-- page 176--><a
name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>obtained
money from the Persians at Sardis, where the satrap at that time
was Cyrus, the son of Darius, the Great King, a clever prince,
who understood something of Greek courage, and saw that the best
thing for Persia was to keep the Greeks fighting with one
another, so that no one state should be mightiest, or able to
meddle with the Persian domains in Asia Minor.&nbsp; He gave
Lysander the means of adding to his forces, and with his new
fleet he plundered the shores of the islands of Salamis and
Eub&oelig;a, and even of Attica itself, to insult the
Athenians.&nbsp; Their fleet came out to drive him off.&nbsp; It
had just been agreed by the Athenians that every prisoner they
might take in the fight they expected should have his right thumb
cut off, to punish the Greeks who had taken Persian gold.&nbsp;
Lysander sailed away, with the Athenian fleet pursuing him up to
the Hellespont, where he took the city of Lampsacus and plundered
it before they came up, and anchored at a place called &AElig;gos
Potami, or the Goat&rsquo;s River, about two miles from
Sestos.&nbsp; In the morning Lysander made all his men eat their
first meal and then go on board, but gave orders that no ship
should stir from its place.&nbsp; The Athenians too embarked,
rowed up to Lampsacus and defied them; but as no Spartan vessel
moved, they went back again to their anchorage, a mere open shore
where there were no houses, so that all the crews went off to
Sestos, or in search of villages inland, to buy provisions.&nbsp;
The very same thing happened the next day.&nbsp; The challenge
was not accepted <!-- page 177--><a name="page177"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 177</span>by the Spartans, and the Athenians
thought them afraid, grew more careless, and went further away
from their ships.&nbsp; But on the hills above stood the little
castle of Alkibiades, who could look down on the strait, see both
fleets, and perceive that the Spartans sent swift galleys out
each day to steal after the Athenians, so that they would be
quite sure to take advantage of their foolish security.&nbsp; He
could not bear to see his fellow-citizens ruining themselves, and
came down to warn them and beg them to move into Sestos, where
they would have the harbour to shelter them and the city behind
them; but the generals scoffed at him, and bade him remember that
they were commanders now, not he, and he went back to his castle,
knowing only too well what would happen.</p>
<p>Till the fifth day all went on as before, but then Lysander
ordered his watching galley to hoist a shield as a signal as soon
as the Athenians had all gone off to roam the country in search
of food, and then he spread out his fleet to its utmost width,
and came rowing out with his 180 ships to fall upon the deserted
Athenians.&nbsp; Not one general was at his post, except Konon,
and he, with the eight galleys he could man in haste, sailed out
in all haste&mdash;not to fight, for that was of no use, but to
escape.&nbsp; Almost every vessel was found empty by the
Spartans, taken or burnt, and then all the men were sought one by
one as they were scattered over the country, except the few who
were near enough to take refuge in the fort of Alkibiades.&nbsp;
Out of the eight <!-- page 178--><a name="page178"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 178</span>ships that got away, one went
straight to Athens to carry the dreadful news; but Konon took the
other seven with him to the island of Cyprus, thinking that thus
he could do better for his country than share the ruin that now
must come upon her.</p>
<p>It was night when the solitary ship reached the Pir&aelig;us
with the dreadful tidings; but they seemed to rush through the
city, for everywhere there broke out a sound of weeping and
wailing for husbands, fathers, brothers, and kinsmen lost, and
men met together in the market-places to mourn and consult what
could be done next.&nbsp; None went to rest that night; but the
fleet was gone, and all their best men with it, and Lysander was
coming down on Athens, putting down all her friends in the
islands by the way, and driving the Athenian garrisons on before
him into Athens.&nbsp; Before long he was at the mouth of the
Pir&aelig;us himself with his 150 galleys, and while he shut the
Athenians in by sea, the Spartan army and its allies blockaded
them by land.</p>
<p>If they held out, there was no hope of help; delay would only
make the conquerors more bitter; so they offered to make terms,
and very hard these were.&nbsp; The Athenians were to pull down a
mile on each side of the Long Walls, give up all their ships
except twelve, recall all their banished men, and follow the
fortunes of the Spartans.&nbsp; They were very unwilling to
accept these conditions, but their distress compelled them; and
Lysander had the Long Walls pulled down to the <!-- page 179--><a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>sound of
music on the anniversary of the day of the battle of
Salamis.&nbsp; Then he overthrew the old constitution of Solon,
and set up a government of thirty men, who were to keep the
Athenians under the Spartan yoke, and who were so cruel and
oppressive that they were known afterwards as the thirty
tyrants.&nbsp; So in 404 ended the Peloponnesian war, after
lasting twenty-seven years.</p>
<p>The Athenians were most miserable, and began to think whether
Alkibiades would deliver them, and the Spartans seem to have
feared the same.&nbsp; He did not think himself safe in Europe
after the ruin at &AElig;gos Potami, and had gone to the Persian
governor on the Phrygian coast, who received him kindly, but was
believed to have taken the pay of either the Spartans or the
thirty tyrants, to murder him, for one night the house where he
was sleeping was set on fire, and on waking he found it
surrounded with enemies.&nbsp; He wrapped his garment round his
left arm, took his sword in his hand, and broke through the
flame.&nbsp; None of the murderers durst come near him, but they
threw darts and stones at him so thickly that at last he fell,
and they despatched him.&nbsp; Timandra, the last of his wives,
took up his body, wrapped it in her own mantle, and buried it in
a city called Melissa.&nbsp; Such was the sad end of the spoilt
child of Athens.&nbsp; He had left a son at Athens, whom the
Thirty tried to destroy, but who escaped their fury, although
during these evil times the Thirty actually put to death no less
than <!-- page 180--><a name="page180"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 180</span>fourteen hundred citizens of Athens,
many of them without any proper trial, and drove five thousand
more into banishment during the eight months that their power
lasted.&nbsp; Then Thrasybulus and other exiles, coming home,
helped to shake off their yoke and establish the old democracy;
but even then Athens was in a weak, wretched state, and Sparta
had all the power.</p>

Greece was quieted by the end of the Peloponnesian war, the old
King of Persia, Darius Nothus, died, and his eldest son,
Artaxerxes Mnemon, came to the throne.&nbsp; He was the eldest,
but his brother Cyrus, who had been born after his father began
to reign, declared that this gave the best right, and resolved to
march from Sardis into Persia to gain the kingdom for himself by
the help of a hired body of Greek soldiers.&nbsp; Clearchus, a
banished Spartan, undertook to get them together, and he made
such descriptions of the wealth they would get in the East, that
11,000 of the bravest men in Greece came together for the
purpose, and among them Xenophon, the pupil of Socrates, who has
written the history of the expedition, as well as that of the
later years of the Peloponnesian war.&nbsp; Xenophon was a
horseman, but most of the troops were foot soldiers, and they
were joined by a great body of Asiatics, raised by Cyrus
himself.&nbsp; They <!-- page 182--><a name="page182"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 182</span>were marched across Syria, crossed
the present river Euphrates at the ford Thapsacus, and at Cunaxa,
seven miles from Babylon, they met the enormous army which
Artaxerxes had raised.&nbsp; The Greeks beat all who met them;
but in the meantime Cyrus was killed, and his whole army broke up
and fled, so that the Greeks were left to themselves in the
enemy&rsquo;s country, without provisions, money, or guides.</p>

<p><!-- page 183--><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>Artaxerxes sent messages pretending to wish to make
terms with them and guide them safely back to their own country,
provided they would do no harm on the way, and they willingly
agreed to this, and let themselves be led where they were told it
would be easier to find food for them; but this was across the
great river Tigris, over a bridge of boats; and a few days after,
Clearchus and the other chief officers were invited to the
Persian camp to meet the king, and there seized and made
prisoners.&nbsp; A message came directly after to the Greeks to
bid them deliver up their arms, as they belonged to the Great
King, having once belonged to his slave Cyrus.</p>
<p>To deliver up their arms was the last thing they intended; but
their plight was dreadful&mdash;left alone eight months&rsquo;
march by the shortest way from home, with two great rivers and
broad tracts of desert between it and themselves, and many
nations, all hating them, in the inhabited land, with no guides,
no generals, and ten times their number of Persian troops waiting
to fall on them.&nbsp; All were in dismay; hardly a fire was
lighted to cook their supper; each man lay down to rest where he
was, yet hardly anyone could sleep for fear and anxiety, looking
for shame, death, or slavery, and never expecting to see Greece,
wife, or children again.</p>
<p>But that night Xenophon made up his mind to do what he could
to save his countrymen.&nbsp; The only hope was in some one
taking the lead, and, as the Greeks <!-- page 184--><a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>had been
true to their oaths throughout the whole march, he believed the
gods would help them.&nbsp; So he called the chief of the
officers still remaining together, and put them in mind that they
might still hope.&nbsp; They were so much stronger and braver
than the Persians, that if only they did not lose heart and
separate, they could beat off almost any attack.&nbsp; As to
provisions, they would seize them, and the rivers which they
could not cross should be their guides, for they would track them
up into the hills, where they would become shallow.&nbsp; Only
every soldier must swear to assist in keeping up obedience, and
then they would show Artaxerxes that, though he had seized
Clearchus, they had ten thousand as good as he.&nbsp; The army
listened, recovered hope and spirit, swore to all he asked, and
one of the most wonderful marches in the world began.&nbsp;
Cheirisophus, the eldest officer, a Spartan, took the command in
the centre; Xenophon, as one of the youngest, was in the
rear.&nbsp; They crossed the Zab, their first barrier, and then
went upwards along the banks of the Tigris.&nbsp; The Persians
hovered about them, and always attacked them every morning.&nbsp;
Then the Greeks halted under any shelter near at hand, and fought
them till towards evening.&nbsp; They were sure to fall back, as
they were afraid to sleep near the Greeks, for fear of a night
attack.&nbsp; Then the Greeks marched on for a good distance
before halting to sup and sleep, and were able again to make a
little way in the morning before the enemy attacked them
again.</p>
<p><!-- page 185--><a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>So they went on till they came to the mountains, where
dwelt wild tribes whom the Great King called his subjects, but
who did not obey him at all.&nbsp; However, they were robbers and
very fierce, and stood on the steep heights shooting arrows and
rolling down stones, so that the passage through their land cost
the Greeks more men than all their march through Persia.&nbsp; On
they went, through Armenia and over the mountains, generally
having to fight their way, and, when they came very high up,
suffering very much from the cold, and having to make their way
through snow and ice, until at last, when they were climbing up
Mount Theche, those behind heard a shout of joy, and the cry,
&ldquo;The sea, the sea!&rdquo; rang from rank to rank.&nbsp; To
every Greek the sea was like home, and it seemed to them as if
their troubles were over.&nbsp; They wept and embraced one
another, and built up a pile of stones with a trophy of arms on
the top, offering sacrifice to the gods for having so far brought
them safely.</p>
<p>It was, however, only the Black Sea, the Pontus Euxinus, and
far to the eastward; and, though the worst was over, they had
still much to undergo while they were skirting the coast of Asia
Minor.&nbsp; When they came to the first Greek
colony&mdash;namely, Trapezus, or Trebizond&mdash;they had been a
full year marching through an enemy&rsquo;s country; and yet out
of the 11,000 who had fought at Cunaxa there were still 10,000
men safe and well, and they had saved all the women, slaves, and
baggage they had taken with them.&nbsp; <!-- page 186--><a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>Moreover,
though they came from many cities, and both Spartans and
Athenians were among them, there never had been any quarrelling;
and the only time when there had been the least dispute had been
when Xenophon thought Cheirisophus a little too hasty in
suspecting a native guide.</p>
<p>Tired out as the soldiers were, they wanted, as soon as they
reached the &AElig;gean Sea, to take ship and sail home; but they
had no money, and the merchant ships would not give them a free
passage, even if there had been ships enough, and Cheirisophus
went to Byzantium to try to obtain some, while the others marched
to wait for him at Cerasus, the place whence were brought the
first cherries, which take their name from it.&nbsp; He failed,
however, in getting any, and the Greeks had to make their way on;
but they had much fallen away from the noble spirit they had
shown at first.&nbsp; Any country that did not belong to Greeks
they plundered, and they were growing careless as to whether the
places in their way were Greek or not.&nbsp; Cheirisophus died of
a fever, and Xenophon, though grieved at the change in the spirit
of the army, continued for very pity in command.&nbsp; They hired
themselves out to fight the battles of a Thracian prince, but,
when his need of them was over, he dismissed them without any pay
at all, and Xenophon was so poor that he was forced to sell the
good horse that had carried him all the way from Armenia.</p>
<p>However, there was a spirited young king at Sparta, <!-- page
187--><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>named Agesilaus, who was just old enough to come
forward and take the command, and he was persuading his
fellow-citizens, that now they had become the leading state in
Greece, they ought to go and deliver the remaining Greek colonies
in Asia Minor from the yoke of Persia, as Athens had done by the
Ionians.&nbsp; They therefore decided on taking the remains of
the 10,000&mdash;now only 6000&mdash;into their pay, and the
messengers who came to engage them bought Xenophon&rsquo;s horse
and restored it to him.&nbsp; Xenophon would not, however,
continue with the band after he had conducted it to Pergamus,
where they were to meet the Spartan general who was to take
charge of them.&nbsp; On their way they plundered the house of a
rich Persian, and gave a large share of the spoil to him as a
token of gratitude for the wisdom and constancy that had carried
them through so many trials.</p>
<p>It had been his strong sense of religion and trust in the care
of the gods which had borne him up; and the first thing he did
was to go and dedicate his armour and an offering of silver at
the temple of Diana at Ephesus.&nbsp; This temple had grown up
round a black stone image, very ugly, but which was said to have
fallen from the sky, and was perhaps a meteoric stone.&nbsp; A
white marble quarry near the city had furnished the materials for
a temple so grand and beautiful that it was esteemed one of the
seven wonders of the world.</p>
<p>After thus paying his vows, Xenophon returned to <!-- page
188--><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>Athens, whence he had been absent two years and
a-half.&nbsp; He not only wrote the history of this expedition,
but a life of the first great Cyrus of Persia, which was meant
not so much as real history, as a pattern of how kings ought to
be bred up.</p>

</a> the men who sought after God in the darkness, &ldquo;if
haply they might feel after Him,&rdquo; none had come so near the
truth as Socrates, a sculptor by trade, and yet a great
philosopher, and, so far as we can see, the wisest and best man
who ever grew up without any guide but nature and
conscience.&nbsp; Even the oracle at Delphi declared that he was
the wisest of men, because he did not fancy he knew what he did
not know, and did not profess to have any wisdom of his
own.&nbsp; It was quite true&mdash;all his thinking had only made
him quite sure that he knew nothing; but he was also sure that he
had an inward voice within him, telling him which was the way in
which he should walk.&nbsp; He did not think much about the wild
tales of the Greek gods and goddesses; he seems to have
considered them as fancies that had grown up on some forgotten
truth, and he said a healthy mind would not dwell upon them; but
he was quite sure that above all these there was one really true
Most High God, who governed the world, rewarded the <!-- page
190--><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>good, punished the bad, and sent him the inward voice,
which he tried to obey to the utmost of his power, and by so
doing, no doubt, his inward sight grew clearer and clearer.&nbsp;
Even in his home his gentleness and patience were noted, so that
when his scolding wife Xantippe, after railing at him sharply,
threw some water at his head, he only smiled, and said,
&ldquo;After thunder follows rain.&rdquo;&nbsp; He did not open a
school under a portico, but, as he did his work, all the choicest
spirits of Greece resorted to him to argue out these questions in
search of truth; and many accounts of these conversations have
been preserved to us by his two best pupils, Plato and
Xenophon.</p>
<p>
<a href="images/p190.jpg">
<img class="floatleft" alt=

</a>But in the latter days of the Peloponnesian war, when the
Athenians were full of bitterness, and had no great deeds to
undertake outside their city, a foolish set of arguing pretenders
to philosophy arose, who were called the Sophists, and who spent
their time in mere empty talk, often against the gods; and the
great Socrates was mixed up in people&rsquo;s fancy with
them.&nbsp; A comic writer arose, named Aristophanes, who, seeing
the Athenians fallen from the greatness of their fathers, tried
to laugh them into shame at themselves.&nbsp; He particularly
disliked Euripides, because his tragedies seemed, like the <!--
page 191--><a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span>Sophists, not to respect the gods; and he also more
justly hated Alkibiades for his overbearing ways, and his want of
all real respect for gods or men.&nbsp; It was very hard on
Socrates that the faults of his pupils should be charged against
him; but Aristophanes had set all Athens laughing by a comedy
called &ldquo;The Clouds,&rdquo; in which a good-for-nothing
young man, evidently meant for Alkibiades, gets his father into
debt by buying horses, and, under the teaching of Socrates,
learns both to cheat his creditors and to treat respect for his
father as a worn-out notion.&nbsp; The beauty and the lisp of
Alkibiades were imitated so as to make it quite plain who was
meant by the youth; and Socrates himself was evidently
represented by an actor in a hideous comic mask, caricaturing the
philosopher&rsquo;s snub nose and ugly features.&nbsp; The play
ended by the young man&rsquo;s father threatening to burn down
the house of Socrates, with him in it.&nbsp; This had been
written twenty years before, but it had been acted and admired
again and again, together with the other comedies of
Aristophanes&mdash;one about a colony of birds who try to build a
city in the air, and of whom the chorus was composed; and
another, called &ldquo;The Frogs,&rdquo; still more droll, and
all full of attacks on the Sophists.</p>
<p>Thus the Athenians had a general notion that Socrates was a
corrupter of youth and a despiser of the gods, for in truth some
forms of worship, like the orgies of Bacchus, and other still
worse rites which had been brought in from the East, were such
that no good man <!-- page 192--><a name="page192"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>could approve them.&nbsp; One of the
thirty tyrants had at one time been a pupil of his, and this
added to the ill-feeling against him; and while Xenophon was
still away in Asia, in the year 399, the philosopher was brought
to trial on three points, namely, that he did not believe in the
gods of Athens, that he brought in new gods, and that he misled
young men; and for this his accusers demanded that he should be
put to death.</p>
<p>Socrates pleaded his own cause before the council of the
Areopagus.&nbsp; He flatly denied unbelief in the gods of his
fathers, but he defended his belief in his genius or in-dwelling
voice, and said that in this he was only like those who drew
auguries from the notes of birds, thunder, and the like; and as
for his guidance of young men, he called on his accusers to show
whether he had ever led any man from virtue to vice.&nbsp; One of
them answered that he knew those who obeyed and followed Socrates
more than their own parents; to which he replied that such things
sometimes happened in other matters&mdash;men consulted
physicians about their health rather than their fathers, and
obeyed their generals in war, not their fathers; and so in
learning, they might follow him rather than their fathers.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Because I am thought to have some power of teaching youth,
O my judges!&rdquo; he ended, &ldquo;is that a reason why I
should suffer death?&nbsp; My accusers may procure that judgment,
but hurt me they cannot.&nbsp; To fear death is to seem wise
without being so, for it is pretending to understand what we know
not.&nbsp; No man knows what death is, or <!-- page 193--><a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>whether it
be not our greatest happiness; yet all fear and shun
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His pupil Plato stood up on the platform to defend him, and
began, &ldquo;O ye Athenians, I am the youngest man who ever went
up in this place&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; they cried, with one voice; &ldquo;the
youngest who ever went down!&rdquo;&nbsp; They would not hear a
word from him; and 280 voices sentenced the great philosopher 
<a href="images/p193.jpg">
<img alt=
"Plato"
title=
"Plato"
src="images/p193.jpg" />
</a> to die, after the Athenian fashion, by being poisoned with
hemlock.&nbsp; He disdained to plead for a lessening of the
penalty; but it could not be carried out at once, because a ship
had just been sent to Delos with offerings, and for the thirty
days while this was gone no one could be put to death.&nbsp;
Socrates therefore was kept in prison, with chains upon his
ankles; but all his friends were able to come and visit him, and
one of them, named Krito, hoped to have contrived his escape by
bribing the jailer, but he refused to make anyone guilty of a
breach of the laws for the sake of a life which must be near its
close, for he was not far from seventy years old; and when one of
his friends began to weep at the thought of his dying innocent,
&ldquo;What!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;would you think it better for
me to die guilty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the ship had come back, and the time was <!-- page
194--><a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>come, he called all his friends together for a cheerful
feast, during which he discoursed to them as usual.&nbsp; All the
words that fell from him were carefully stored up, and recorded
by Plato in a dialogue, which is one of the most valuable things
that have come down to us from Greek times.&nbsp; It was not
Socrates, said the philosopher, whom they would lay in the
grave.&nbsp; Socrates&rsquo; better part, and true self, would be
elsewhere; and all of them felt sure that in that unknown world,
as they told him, it must fare well with one like him.&nbsp; He
begged them, for their own sakes, never to forget the lessons he
had taught them; and when the time had come, he drank the hemlock
as if it had been a cup of wine: he then walked up and down the
room for a little while, bade his pupils remember that this was
the real deliverance from all disease and impurity, and then, as
the fatal sleep benumbed him, he lay down, bidding Krito not
forget a vow he had made to one of the gods; and so he slept into
death.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thus,&rdquo; said Plato, &ldquo;died the man
who, of all with whom we were acquainted, was in death the
noblest, in life the wisest and the best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Plato himself carried on much of the teaching of his master,
and became the founder of a sect of philosophy which taught that,
come what may, virtue is that which should, above all, be sought
for as making man noblest, and that no pain, loss, or grief
should be shunned for virtue&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; His followers
were called Stoics, from their fashion of teaching in the
porticos or porches, which in Greek were named
<i>stoai</i>.&nbsp; Their great <!-- page 195--><a
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>opponents
were the Epicureans, or followers of a philosopher by name
Epicurus, who held that as man&rsquo;s life is short, and as he
knew not whence he came, nor whither he went, he had better make
himself as happy as possible, and care for nothing else.&nbsp;
Epicurus, indeed, declared that only virtue did make men happy;
but there was nothing in his teaching to make them do anything
but what pleased themselves, so his philosophy did harm, while
that of the Stoics did good.&nbsp; A few Pythagoreans, who
believed in the harmony of the universe, still remained; but as
long as the world remained in darkness, thinking men were
generally either Stoics or Epicureans.</p>

ablest man just at this time in Greece was Agesilaus, one of the
kings of Sparta.&nbsp; He was small, weakly, and lame, but full
of courage, and an excellent general; and though he was as plain
and hardy as suited with Spartan discipline, he had a warm, kind,
tender heart, and was not ashamed to show it, as some of the
Spartans were.&nbsp; So that, when some ambassadors came to see
him, they found him riding on a stick to please his children; and
again, when a trial of a distinguished man was going on in his
absence, he wrote, &ldquo;If he be not guilty, spare him for his
own sake; if he be guilty, spare him for mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was young, and full of fire and spirit, when the Spartans
resolved to try to free the Greek colonies in Asia Minor from the
Persians, by an army under his command.&nbsp; Xenophon had been
so much grieved by his master Socrates&rsquo; death that he would
not remain at Athens, but joined his old friends once more, and
was a great friend of Agesilaus.&nbsp; The Athenians, <!-- page
197--><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
197</span>Corinthians, and Thebans were all asked to send troops,
but they refused, and Agesilaus set sail with 8000 men, meaning
to meet and take with him the remains of the 10,000, who were
well used to warfare with the Persians.&nbsp; He was the first
Greek king who had sailed to Asia since the Trojan war, and, in
imitation of Agamemnon, he stopped at Aulis, in B&oelig;otia, to
offer sacrifice to Diana.&nbsp; He dreamt that a message came
that it ought to be the same sacrifice as Agamemnon had made, but
he declared that he would not act so cruelly towards his own
child, and caused a white hind to be crowned, and offered as the
goddess&rsquo; chosen offering; but as this was not the usual
sacrifice, the Thebans were affronted, and threw away the
sacrifice as it lay on the altar.&nbsp; This was reckoned as a
bad omen, and Agesilaus went on his way, doubting whether he
should meet with success.</p>
<p>He was a man who went very much by omens, for after he had
landed, had gained several successes, and was just advancing into
Caria, at the sacrifice he found the liver of one of the victims
imperfect, and this decided him on going back to Ephesus for the
winter, to collect more horse.&nbsp; When he marched on in the
spring he was much stronger; he advanced into the Persian
territories, and defeated the Persians and their allies wherever
he met them, and at last the satrap Pharnabazus begged to have a
conference with him, being much struck with his valour.</p>
<p>Agesilaus came first to the place of meeting, and <!-- page
198--><a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>having to wait there, sat down on the grass under a
tree, and began to eat his homely meal of bread and an
onion.&nbsp; Presently up came the satrap in all his splendour,
with attendants carrying an umbrella over his head, and others
bearing rich carpets and costly furs for him to sit on, silver
and gold plate, and rich food and wines.&nbsp; But when he found
that the little, shabby, plain man under the tree was really the
mighty king of Sparta, the descendant of Hercules, Pharnabazus
was ashamed of all his pomp, and went down upon the ground by
Agesilaus&rsquo; side, to the great damage, as the Greeks
delighted to observe, of his fine, delicately-tinted robes.&nbsp;
He told Agesilaus that he thought this attack a bad reward for
all the help that the Spartans had had from Persia in the
Peloponnesian war; but Agesilaus said that they had been friends
then, but that as cause of war had arisen it was needful to
fight, though he was so far from feeling enmity that Pharnabazus
should find the Greeks willing to welcome him, and give him high
command, if he would come and be a free man among them.&nbsp;
Pharnabazus answered that as long as he held command in the name
of the Great King he must be at war with the foes of Persia, but
if Artaxerxes should take away his satrapy he would come over to
the Spartans.&nbsp; Therewith Agesilaus shook hands with him, and
said, &ldquo;How much rather I would have so gallant a man for my
friend than my enemy?&rdquo;&nbsp; The young son of the satrap
was even more taken with the Spartan, and, waiting behind his
father, <!-- page 199--><a name="page199"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 199</span>ran up to the king, and, according
to the Persian offer of friendship, said, &ldquo;I make you my
guest,&rdquo; at the same time giving him a javelin.&nbsp;
Agesilaus looked about for anything fine enough to offer the
young Persian in return, and seeing that a youth in his train had
a horse with handsome trappings, asked for them, and made a gift
of them to his new friend.&nbsp; The friendship stood the youth
in good stead, for when he was afterwards driven from home by his
brethren, Agesilaus welcomed him in Laconia, and was very kind to
him.&nbsp; The war, however, still continued, and Agesilaus
gained such successes that the Persians saw their best hope lay
in getting him recalled to Greece; so they sent money in secret
to the Athenians and their old allies to incite them to revolt,
and so strong an army was brought together that the Spartans sent
in haste to recall Agesilaus.&nbsp; The summons came just as he
was mustering all the Greek warriors in Asia Minor for an advance
into the heart of the empire, and he was much disappointed; but
he laughed, and, as Persian coins were stamped with the figure of
a horseman drawing the bow, he said he had been defeated by
10,000 Persian archers.</p>
<p>He marched home by the way of the Hellespont, but before he
was past Thrace a great battle had been fought close to Corinth,
in which the Spartans had been victorious and made a great
slaughter of the allies.&nbsp; But he only thought of them as
Greeks, not as enemies, and exclaimed, &ldquo;O Greece, how many
brave <!-- page 200--><a name="page200"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 200</span>men hast thou lost, who might have
conquered all Persia!&rdquo;&nbsp; The Thebans had joined the
allies against Sparta, and the Ephors sent orders to Agesilaus to
punish them on his way southwards.&nbsp; This he did in the
battle of Coronea, in which he was very badly wounded, but, after
the victory was over, he would not be taken to his tent till he
had been carried round the field to see that every slain Spartan
was carried away in his armour and not left to the
plunderers.</p>
<p>He then returned to Sparta, where the citizens were delighted
to see that he had not been spoiled by Persian luxury, but lived
as plainly as ever, and would not let his family dress
differently from others.&nbsp; He knew what greatness was so
well, that when he heard Artaxerxes called the Great King, he
said, &ldquo;How is he greater than I, unless he be the
juster?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It should be remembered that Konon, that Athenian captain who
had escaped from &AElig;gos Potami with six ships, had gone to
the island of Cyprus.&nbsp; He persuaded the people of the island
of Rhodes to revolt from the Spartans, and make friends with the
Persians.&nbsp; It is even said that he went to the court of
Artaxerxes, and obtained leave from him to raise ships, with
which to attack the Spartans, from the colonies which were
friendly to Athens, yet belonged to the Greek Empire.&nbsp;
Pharnabazus joined him, and, with eighty-five ships, they cruised
about in the &AElig;gean Sea, and near Cnidus they entirely
defeated the Spartan fleet.&nbsp; It was commanded by Pisander,
Agesilaus&rsquo; brother-in-law, who held by his <!-- page
201--><a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span>ship to the last, and died like a true Spartan, sword
in hand.</p>
<p>After this Konon drove out many Spartan governors from the
islands of the &AElig;gean, and, sailing to Corinth, encouraged
the citizens to hold out against Sparta, after which Pharnabazus
went home, but Konon returned with the fleet to the Pir&aelig;us,
and brought money and aid to build up the Long Walls again, after
they had been ten years in ruins.&nbsp; The crews of the ships
and the citizens of Athens all worked hard, the rejoicing was
immense, and Konon was looked on as the great hero and benefactor
of Athens; but, as usual, before long the Athenians grew jealous
of him and drove him out, so that he ended his life an exile,
most likely in Cyprus.</p>
<p>It was no wonder that Xenophon&rsquo;s heart turned against
the city that thus treated her great men, though he ought not to
have actually fought against her, as he did under Agesilaus, whom
he greatly loved.&nbsp; The chief scene of the war was round
Corinth; but at last both parties were wearied, and a peace was
made between Athens and Sparta and the Persian Empire.&nbsp;
Artaxerxes kept all the Greek cities in Asia and the islands of
Cyprus and Clazomene, and all the other isles and colonies were
declared free from the power of any city, except the isles of
Lemnos, Imbros, and Scyros, which were still to belong to
Athens.&nbsp; Sparta required of Thebes to give up her power over
the lesser cities of B&oelig;otia, but Sparta herself did not
give <!-- page 202--><a name="page202"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 202</span>up Messenia and the other districts
in the Peloponnesus, so that she still remained the
strongest.&nbsp; This was called the peace of Antaleidas.</p>
<p>Xenophon did not go back to Athens, but settled on a farm near
Elis, where he built a little temple to Diana, in imitation of
the one at Ephesus, and spent his time in husbandry, in hunting,
and in writing his histories, and also treatises on dogs and
horses.&nbsp; Once a-year he held a great festival in honour of
Diana, offering her the tithe of all his produce, and feasting
all the villagers around on barley meal, wheaten bread, meat, and
venison, the last of which was obtained at a great hunting match
conducted by Xenophon himself and his sons.</p>

<img class='dc' alt='B' title='B' src='images/dcb.jpg' />y the
peace of Antaleidas things had been so settled that the Spartans
had the chief power over Greece, and they used it in their proud,
harsh way.&nbsp; In the year 387 they called the Thebans to
assist in besieging the city of Mantinea, in a valley between
Argos and Arcadia.&nbsp; The Mantineans sallied out, and there
was a battle, in which they were defeated; but in the course of
it a Theban youth of a rich and noble family, named Pelopidas,
was surrounded by enemies.&nbsp; He fought desperately, and only
fell at last under seven wounds just as another Theban, a little
older, named Epaminondas, broke into his rescue, and fought over
him until the Spartans made in and bore them off, but not till
Epaminondas had likewise been badly wounded.&nbsp; He was the son
of a poor but noble father, said to be descended from one of the
men who had sprung from the dragon&rsquo;s teeth; and he had been
well taught, and was an earnest philosopher of the Pythagorean
school, striving to the utmost of his power to <!-- page 204--><a
name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>live a good
and virtuous life.&nbsp; A close friendship grew up between him
and Pelopidas, though the one loved books, and the other, dogs
and horses; but Pelopidas tried to be as upright and noble as his
friend, and, though a very rich man, lived as hardily and
sparingly as did Epaminondas, using his wealth to help the
poor.&nbsp; When some foolish friends asked him why he did not
use his riches for his own ease and pomp, he laughed at them,
and, pointing to a helpless cripple, said that riches were only
useful to a man like that.</p>
<p>Every high-spirited Theban hated the power that Sparta had
taken over their free state, and wanted to shake it off; but some
of those who were bribed by Sparta sent word of their intentions
to a Spartan general in the neighbourhood, whereupon he came down
on Thebes in the middle of a festival, seized the citadel called
the Cadmea, put in a Spartan garrison, and drove 300 of the best
Thebans into exile.&nbsp; Pelopidas was among them, while
Epaminondas was thought of only as a poor student, and was
unnoticed; but he went quietly on advising the Theban young men
to share the warlike exercises of the Spartans in the Cadmea, so
as to get themselves trained to arms in case there should be a
chance of fighting for their freedom.&nbsp; In the fourth year of
the exile, Pelopidas wrote to beg his friend to join in a plot by
which some of the banished were to creep into the city, go to a
banquet that was to be given to the chief friends of the Spartans
disguised as women, kill them, proclaim liberty, raise the
citizens, <!-- page 205--><a name="page205"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 205</span>and expel the Spartans.&nbsp; But
Epaminondas would have nothing to do with a scheme that involved
falsehood and treachery, however much he longed to see his
country free.&nbsp; But on a dark, winter evening, Pelopidas and
eleven more young exiles came one by one into Thebes, in the
disguise of hunters, and met at the house of the friend who was
going to give the feast.&nbsp; They were there dressed in robes
and veils, and in the height of the mirth the host brought them
in, and they fell upon the half-tipsy guests and slew them, while
Pelopidas had gone to the house of the most brave and sober among
them, challenged him, and killed him in fair fight.&nbsp; Then
they shouted, &ldquo;Freedom!&nbsp; Down with the
foe!&rdquo;&nbsp; The citizens rose, Epaminondas among the first;
the rest of the exiles marched in at daybreak, and the Cadmea was
besieged until the Spartans were obliged to march out, and Thebes
was left to its own government by B&oelig;otarchs, or rulers of
B&oelig;otia, for a year at a time, of whom Pelopidas was at once
chosen to be one.</p>
<p>Of course there was a war, in which the Thebans were helped by
Athens, but more from hatred to Sparta than love to Thebes.&nbsp;
After six years there was a conference to arrange for a peace,
and Epaminondas, who was then B&oelig;otarch, spoke so well as to
amaze all hearers.&nbsp; Agesilaus demanded that the Thebans
should only make terms for themselves, and give up the rest of
B&oelig;otia, and Epaminondas would not consent unless in like
manner Sparta gave up the rule over the other <!-- page 206--><a
name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>places in
Laconia.&nbsp; The Athenians would not stand by the Thebans, and
all the allies made peace, so that Thebes was left alone to
resist Sparta, and Epaminondas had to hurry home to warn her to
defend herself.</p>
<p>The only thing in favour of Thebes was that Agesilaus&rsquo;
lame leg had become so diseased that he could not for five years
go out to war; but the other king, Cleombrotus, was at the head
of 11,000 men marching into B&oelig;otia, and Epaminondas could
only get together 6000, with whom he met them at Leuctra.&nbsp;
No one doubted how the battle would end, for the Spartans had
never yet been beaten, even by the Athenians, when they had the
larger numbers, and, besides, the quiet scholar Epaminondas had
never been thought of as a captain.&nbsp; The omens went against
the Thebans, but he said he knew no token that ought to forbid a
man from fighting for his country.&nbsp; Pelopidas commanded the
horsemen, and Epaminondas drew up his troop in a column fifty men
deep, with which he dashed at the middle of the Spartan army,
which was only three lines deep, and Pelopidas&rsquo; cavalry
hovered about to cut them down when they were broken.&nbsp; The
plan succeeded perfectly.&nbsp; Cleombrotus was carried dying
from the field, and Epaminondas had won the most difficult
victory ever yet gained by a Greek.&nbsp; So far from being
uplifted by it, all he said was how glad he was that his old
father and mother would be pleased.&nbsp; The victory had made
Thebes the most powerful city in Greece, and he was the leading
man in Thebes for <!-- page 207--><a name="page207"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 207</span>some time; but he had enemies, who
thought him too gentle with their foes, whether men or cities,
and one year, in the absence of Pelopidas, they chose him to be
inspector of the cleanliness of the streets, thinking to put a
slur on him; but he fulfilled the duties of it so perfectly that
he made the office itself an honourable one.</p>
<p>Pelopidas was soon after sent on a message to Alexander, the
savage tyrant of Thessaly, who seized him and put him in chains
in a dismal dungeon.&nbsp; The Theban army marched to deliver
him, Epaminondas among them as a common soldier; but the two
B&oelig;otarchs in command managed so ill that they were beset by
the Thessalian horsemen and forced to turn back.&nbsp; In the
retreat they were half-starved, and fell into such danger and
distress, that all cried out for Epaminondas to lead them, and he
brought them out safely.&nbsp; The next year he was chosen
B&oelig;otarch, again attacked Thessaly, and, by the mere dread
of his name, made the tyrant yield up Pelopidas, and beg for a
truce.&nbsp; Pelopidas brought home such horrible accounts of the
cruelties of Alexander, that as soon as the truce was over, 7000
men, with him at their head, invaded Thessaly, and won the battle
of Cynocephal&aelig;, or the Dogs&rsquo; Heads.&nbsp; Here
Pelopidas was killed, to the intense grief of the army, who cut
their hair and their horses&rsquo; manes and tails, lighted no
fire, and tasted no food on that sad night after their victory,
and great was the mourning at Thebes for the brave and upright
man who had been thirteen times B&oelig;otarch.&nbsp; Epaminondas
was at <!-- page 208--><a name="page208"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 208</span>sea with the fleet he had persuaded
the Thebans to raise; but the next year he was sent into the
Peloponnesus to defend the allies there against the
Spartans.&nbsp; He had almost taken the city itself, when the
army hastened back to defend it, under the command of Agesilaus,
who had recovered and taken the field again.</p>
<p>Close to Mantinea, where Epaminondas had fought his first
battle, he had to fight again with the only general who had as
yet a fame higher than his&mdash;namely, Agesilaus&mdash;and
Xenophon was living near enough to watch the battle.&nbsp; It was
a long, fiercely-fought combat, but at last the Spartans began to
give way and broke their ranks, still, however, flinging
javelins, one of which struck Epaminondas full in the breast, and
broke as he fell, leaving a long piece of the shaft fixed in the
wound.&nbsp; His friends carried him away up the hill-side, where
he found breath to ask whether his shield were safe, and when it
was held up to him, he looked down on the Spartans in full
flight, and knew he had won the day.&nbsp; He was in great pain,
and he was told that to draw out the spear would probably kill
him at once.&nbsp; He said, therefore, that he must wait till he
could speak to the two next in command; and when he was told that
they were both slain, he said, &ldquo;Then you must make
peace,&rdquo; for he knew no one was left able to contend against
Agesilaus.&nbsp; As his friends wept, he said, &ldquo;This day is
not the end of my life, but the beginning of my happiness and
completion of my glory;&rdquo; and when they bewailed that he
<!-- page 209--><a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
209</span>had no child, he said, &ldquo;Leuctra and Mantinea are
daughters enough to keep my name alive.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, as
those who stood round faltered, unable to resolve to draw out the
dart, he pulled it out himself with a firm hand, and the rush of
blood that followed ended one of the most beautiful lives ever
spent by one who was a law unto himself.&nbsp; He was buried
where he died, and a pillar was raised over the spot bearing the
figure of a dragon, in memory of his supposed dragon lineage.</p>

made as Epaminondas desired, and B&oelig;otia never produced
another great man, as, indeed, the inhabitants had always been
slow and dull, so that a B&oelig;otian was a by-word for
stupidity.&nbsp; The only other great B&oelig;otian was the poet
Pindar, who was living at this time.</p>
<p>The fifteen years of Theban power had weakened Sparta; but
Agesilaus persuaded the Ephors to send him to assist Tachos, who
had revolted from the Persians and made himself king of Egypt,
and who promised to pay the Spartans well for their aid.&nbsp;
When he sent his officers to receive the Spartan king who had
achieved the greatest fame of any man then living, they
absolutely burst out laughing at the sight of the little, lame
man, now more than eighty years old, and as simply clad as ever;
and he was much vexed and angered that he was not made commander
of the army, but only of the foreign allies; and when Tachos went
against his advice, and chose to march into Ph&oelig;nicia, <!--
page 211--><a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
211</span>he went over to the cause of another Egyptian prince, a
cousin to Tachos, named Nectanebes, whom he helped to gain the
crown of Egypt, thus breaking his promises in a way which we are
sorry should have been the last action of his long life.&nbsp;
The next winter he embarked to return home, but he was driven by
contrary winds to a place in Egypt called the port of Menelaus,
because that king of Sparta had been so long weather-bound
there.&nbsp; The storm had been too much for the tough old frame
of Agesilaus, who died there.&nbsp; His body was embalmed in wax,
and carried home to be buried at Sparta, whose greatest man he
certainly was.</p>
<p>The great Persian Empire was growing weak, and her subject
cities were revolting from her.&nbsp; Caria, in Asia Minor,
became free under its king, Mausolus, who reigned twenty-four
years, but who is chiefly famous for the magnificent monument
which his widow Artemisia raised to his memory, and which
consisted of several stages of pillars, supported by tablets so
exquisitely sculptured that the Mausoleum, as it was called, was
taken into the number of the seven wonders of the world.&nbsp;
After all, its splendour did not comfort the heart of Artemisia,
and she had the ashes of her husband taken from his urn and
carried them about her in a casket, until finally she put them in
water and drank them, so as to be for ever one with them.&nbsp;
She was herself buried in the Mausoleum, the remains of which
have lately been discovered, and are now placed in the British
Museum.</p>
<p><!-- page 212--><a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>One more great man had grown up in Athens&mdash;namely,
Demosthenes.&nbsp; He was the son of an Athenian sword merchant,
who died when he was but seven years 
<a href="images/p212.jpg">
<img alt=

src="images/p212.jpg" />
</a> old.&nbsp; His guardians neglected his property, and he was
a sickly boy, with some defect in his speech, so that his mother
kept him at home as much as she could, and he was never trained
in mind or body like the other Athenian youth; but, as he grew
older, he seems to have learned much from the philosopher Plato,
and he set himself to lead the Athenians as a public
speaker.&nbsp; For this he prepared himself diligently, putting
pebbles in his mouth to overcome his stammering, and going out to
make speeches to the roaring waves of the sea, that he might
learn not to be daunted by the shouts of the raging people; and
thus he taught <!-- page 213--><a name="page213"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 213</span>himself to be the most famous orator
in the world, just as Phidias was the greatest sculptor and
&AElig;schylus the chief tragedian.</p>
<p>His most eloquent discourses are called Philippics, because
they were against Philip, king of Macedon, a power that was
growing very dangerous to the rest of Greece.&nbsp; It lay to the
northward of the other states, and had never quite been reckoned
as part of Greece, for a rough dialect that was spoken there, and
the king had been forced to join the Persian army when Xerxes
crossed his country; but he had loved the Greek cause, and had
warned Aristides at the battle of Plat&aelig;a.&nbsp; The royal
family counted Hercules as their forefather, and were always
longing to be accepted as thorough Greeks.&nbsp; One of the young
princes, named Philip, was taken to Thebes by Pelopidas, to
secure him from his enemies at home.&nbsp; He was lodged in the
house of Epaminondas&rsquo; father, and was much struck with the
grand example he there beheld, though he cared more for the
lessons of good policy he then learned than for those of
virtue.</p>
<p>Two years after the battle of Mantinea, Philip heard that his
elder brother, the king, was dead, leaving only a young infant
upon the throne.&nbsp; He went home at once and took the
guardianship of the kingdom, gained some great victories over the
wild neighbours of Macedon, to the north, and then made himself
king, but without hurting his nephew, who grew up quietly at his
court, and by-and-by married one of his daughters.&nbsp; <!--
page 214--><a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
214</span>He had begun to train his troops to excellent
discipline, perfecting what was called the Macedonian phalanx, a
manner of arraying his forces which he had learned in part from
Epaminondas.&nbsp; The phalanx was a body of heavily-armed foot
soldiers, each carrying a shield, and a spear twenty-four feet
long.&nbsp; When they advanced, they were taught to lock their
shields together, so as to form a wall, and they stood in ranks,
one behind the other, so that the front row had four spear points
projecting before them.</p>
<p>He also made the Macedonian nobles send their sons to be
trained to arms at his court, so as to form a guard of honour,
who were comrades, friends, and officers to the king.&nbsp; In
the meantime, wars were going on&mdash;one called the Social War
and one the Sacred War&mdash;which wasted the strength of the
Thebans, Spartans, and Athenians all alike, until Philip began to
come forward, intending to have power over them all.&nbsp; At
first, he marched into Thrace, the wild country to the north, and
laid siege to Methone.&nbsp; In this city there was an archer,
named Aster, who had once offered his service to the Macedonian
army, when Philip, who cared the most for his phalanx, rejected
him contemptuously, saying, &ldquo;I will take you into my pay
when I make war on starlings.&rdquo;&nbsp; This man shot an
arrow, with the inscription on it, &ldquo;To Philip&rsquo;s right
eye;&rdquo; and it actually hit the mark, and put out the
eye.&nbsp; Philip caused it to be shot back again with the
inscription, &ldquo;If Philip takes the city, he will hang
Aster.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so he <!-- page 215--><a
name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>did.&nbsp;
Indeed he took the loss of his eye so much to heart, that he was
angry if anyone mentioned a Cyclops in his presence.</p>
<p>After taking Methone, he was going to pass into Thessaly, but
the Athenians held Thermopyl&aelig;, and he waited till he could
ally himself with the Thebans against the Phocians.&nbsp; He took
Phocis, and thus gained the famous pass, being able to attack it
on both sides.&nbsp; Next he listened to envoys from Messenia and
Argos, who complained of the dominion of the Spartans, and begged
him to help them.&nbsp; The Athenians were on this urged by
Demosthenes, in one of his Philippics, to forget all their old
hatred to Sparta, and join her in keeping back the enemy of both
alike; and their intention of joining Sparta made Philip wait,
and begin by trying to take the great island of Eub&oelig;a,
which he called the &ldquo;Shackles of Greece.&rdquo;&nbsp; To
its aid was sent a body of Athenians, under the command of
Phocion, a friend of Plato, and one of the sternest of Stoics, of
whom it was said that no one had ever seen him laugh, weep, or go
to the public baths.&nbsp; He went about barefoot, and never
wrapped himself up if he could help it, so that it was a saying,
&ldquo;Phocion has got his cloak on; it is a hard
winter.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was a great soldier, and, for the time,
drove back the Macedonians from Eub&oelig;a.&nbsp; But very few
Athenians had the spirit of Phocion or Demosthenes.&nbsp; They
had grown idle, and Philip was bribing all who would take his
money among the other Greeks to let his power and influence
spread, <!-- page 216--><a name="page216"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 216</span>until at last he set forth to invade
Greece.&nbsp; The Thebans and Athenians joined together to stop
him, and met him at Ch&aelig;ronea, in B&oelig;otia; but neither
city could produce a real general, and though at first the
Athenians gained some advantage, they did not make a proper use
of it, so that Philip cried out, &ldquo;The Athenians do not know
how to conquer,&rdquo; and, making another attack, routed them
entirely.&nbsp; Poor Demosthenes, who had never been in a battle
before, and could only fight with his tongue, fled in such a
fright that when a bramble caught his tunic, he screamed out,
&ldquo;Oh, spare my life!&rdquo;&nbsp; The battle of
Ch&aelig;ronea was a most terrible overthrow, and neither Athens
nor Thebes ever recovered it.&nbsp; Macedon entirely gained the
chief power over Greece, and Philip was the chief man in it,
though Demosthenes never ceased to try to stir up opposition to
him.&nbsp; Philip was a very able man, and had a good deal of
nobleness in his nature.&nbsp; Once, after a feast, he had to
hear a trial, and gave sentence in haste.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
appeal,&rdquo; said the woman who had lost.&nbsp; &ldquo;Appeal?
and to whom?&rdquo; said the king.&nbsp; &ldquo;I appeal from
Philip drunk to Philip sober.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was greatly struck,
heard the case over again the next day, and found that he had
been wrong and the woman right.</p>

Macedon married Olympias, the daughter of the king of Epirus, who
traced his descent up to Achilles.&nbsp; She was beautiful, but
fierce and high-spirited; and the first time Philip saw her she
was keeping the feast of Bacchus, and was dancing fearlessly
among great serpents, which twisted about among the
maidens&rsquo; vine-wreathed staves, their baskets of figs, and
even the ivy crowns on their heads.&nbsp; Her wild beauty charmed
him, and he asked her in marriage as soon as he had gained the
throne.&nbsp; The son of this marriage, Alexander, was born at
Pella in 356.&nbsp; On the same day a great battle was won by
Parmenio, Philip&rsquo;s chief general, and the king&rsquo;s
horses won the prize at the Olympic games.&nbsp; Philip was so
prosperous that he declared he must sacrifice to the gods, or
they would be jealous, and cast him down in the midst of his
happiness.&nbsp; That same night the wonder of the world, the
temple of Diana at Ephesus, was burnt down by a madman named
Erostratus, who thought the deed would make <!-- page 218--><a
name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>him for
ever famous.&nbsp; It was built up again more splendidly than
ever, and the image was saved.</p>

</a>The chief physician at Philip&rsquo;s court was Aristotle, a
Macedonian of Stagyra, who had studied under Plato, and was one
of the greatest and best of philosophers; and Philip wrote to him
at once that he rejoiced not only in having a son, but in his
having been born when he could have Aristotle for a tutor.&nbsp;
For seven years, however, the boy was under the care of a noble
lady named Lanika, whom he loved all his life, and then was
placed with a master, who taught him to repeat the <i>Iliad</i>
and <i>Odyssey</i> from end to end.&nbsp; He delighted in them so
much that he always carried a copy about with him, and constantly
dreamt of equalling his great forefather Achilles.</p>
<p>When he was about thirteen, a magnificent black horse called
Bucephalus, or Bull-head, because it had a white mark like a
bull&rsquo;s face on its forehead, was brought to Philip; but it
was so strong and restive that nobody could manage it, and Philip
was sending it away, when Alexander begged leave to try to tame
it.&nbsp; First he turned its head to the sun, having perceived
that its antics were caused by fear of its own shadow; then <!--
page 219--><a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
219</span>stroking and caressing it as he held the reins, he
gently dropped his fluttering mantle and leaped on its back,
sitting firm through all its leaps and bounds, but using neither
whip nor spur nor angry voice, till at last the creature was
brought to perfect obedience.&nbsp; This gentle courage and
firmness so delighted Philip that he embraced the boy with tears
of joy, and gave him the horse, which, as long as it lived, loved
and served him like no one else.&nbsp; Philip also said that such
a boy might be treated as a man, and therefore put him under
Aristotle three years earlier than it was usual to begin
philosophy; and again he was an apt and loving scholar, learning
great wisdom in dealing with men and things, and, in truth,
learning everything but how to control his temper.</p>
<p>At the battle of Ch&aelig;ronea, Alexander was old enough to
command the division which fought against the Thebans, and
entirely overthrew them; so that when peace was made, Sparta was
the only city that refused to own the superior might of Macedon,
and the Council of the States chose Philip as commander of the
Greeks in the grand expedition he was going to undertake against
Persia.</p>
<p>But Philip had eastern vices.&nbsp; He was tired of
Olympias&rsquo; pride and wilfulness, and took another wife, whom
he raised to the position of queen; and at the banquet a
half-tipsy kinsman of this woman insulted Alexander, who threw a
cup at the man.&nbsp; Philip started up to chastise his son, but,
between rage and wine, fell down, while Alexander said,
&ldquo;See, a man preparing to <!-- page 220--><a
name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>cross from
Europe to Asia cannot step safely from one couch to
another!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he took his mother to her native home, and stayed away
till his father sent for him, but kept him in a kind of disgrace,
until at the wedding feast of Alexander&rsquo;s sister Cleopatra
with the king of Epirus, just as Philip came forward in a white
garment, a man darted forward and thrust a sword through his
body, then fled so fast that he would have escaped if his foot
had not been caught in some vine stocks, so that the guards cut
him to pieces.</p>
<p>Alexander was proclaimed king, at only twenty years old; and
Demosthenes was so delighted at the death of the enemy of Athens,
that he wreathed his head with a garland in token of joy, little
guessing that Philip&rsquo;s murder had only placed a far greater
man on the throne.&nbsp; The first thing Alexander did was to go
to Corinth, and get himself chosen in his father&rsquo;s stead
captain-general of the Greeks.&nbsp; Only the Spartans refused,
saying it was their custom to lead, and not to follow; while the
Athenians pretended to submit, meaning to take the first
opportunity of breaking off the yoke.&nbsp; Before Alexander
could march, however, to Persia, he had to leave all safe behind
him; so he turned northwards to subdue the wild tribes in
Thrace.&nbsp; He was gone four months, and the Greeks heard
nothing of him, so that the Thebans thought he must be lost, and
proclaimed that they were free from the power of Macedon.</p>
<p><!-- page 221--><a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
221</span>Their punishment was terrible.&nbsp; Alexander came
back in haste, fought them in their own town, hunted them from
street to street, killed or made slaves of all who had not been
friends of his father, pulled down all the houses, and divided
the lands between the other B&oelig;otian cities.&nbsp; This was
for the sake of making an example of terror; but he afterwards
regretted this act, and, as Bacchus was the special god of
Thebes, he thought himself punished by the fits of rage that
seized him after any excess in wine.&nbsp; The other Greeks, all
but the Spartans, again sent envoys to meet Alexander at Corinth,
and granted him all the men, stores, and money he asked
for.&nbsp; The only person who did not bow down to him was
Diogenes, a philosopher who so exaggerated Stoicism that he was
called the &ldquo;Mad Socrates.&rdquo;&nbsp; His sect were called
Cynics, from Cyon, a dog, because they lived like dogs, seldom
washing, and sleeping in any hole.&nbsp; Diogenes&rsquo; lair was
a huge earthenware tub, that belonged to the temple of the mother
of the gods, Cybele; and here Alexander went to see him, and
found him basking in the sun before it, but not choosing to take
any notice of the princely youth who addressed him&mdash;&ldquo;I
am Alexander the King.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I am Diogenes the Cynic,&rdquo; was the answer, in
a tone as if he thought himself quite as good as the king.&nbsp;
Alexander, however, talked much with him, and ended by asking if
he could do anything for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only stand out of my sunshine,&rdquo; was the answer;
<!-- page 222--><a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
222</span>and as the young king went away he said, &ldquo;If I
were not Alexander, I would be Diogenes;&rdquo; meaning, perhaps,
that if he were not to master all earthly things, he would rather
despise them.&nbsp; Twelve years later, Diogenes, then past
ninety, was found dead in his tub, having supped the night before
upon the raw leg of an ox; and, strangely enough, it was the very
night that Alexander died.</p>

</a>Alexander was going on with his preparations for conquering
the East.&nbsp; He had 12,000 foot soldiers from Macedon, trained
to fight in the terrible phalanx, and 5000 horsemen; also his own
bodyguard of young nobles, bred up with him at Pella; 7000 men
from the Greek states, and 5000 who had been used, like the
10,000 of Xenophon, to hire themselves out to the Persians, and
thus knew the languages, manners, roads, and ways of fighting in
the East; but altogether he had only 34,500 men with which to
attack the empire which stretched from the <!-- page 223--><a
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>&AElig;gean
to Scythia, from the Euxine to the African deserts.&nbsp; Such
was his liberality in gifts before he went away, that when he was
asked what he had left for himself, he answered, &ldquo;My
hopes;&rdquo; and his hope was not merely to conquer that great
world, but to tame it, bring it into order, and teach the men
there the wisdom and free spirit of the Greek world; for he had
learnt from Aristotle that to make men true, brave, virtuous, and
free was the way to be godlike.&nbsp; It was in his favour that
the direct line of Persian kings had failed, and that there had
been wars and factions all through the last reign.&nbsp; The
present king was Codomanus, a grand-nephew of that Artaxerxes
against whom Cyrus had led the ten thousand.&nbsp; He had come to
the throne in 336, the same year as Alexander, and was known as
Darius, the royal name he had taken.&nbsp; Alexander made his
father&rsquo;s counsellor, Antipater, governor of Macedon in his
absence, and took leave of his mother and his home in the spring
of 334.</p>

passed the Hellespont in the April of 334, steering his own
vessel, and was the first to leap on shore.&nbsp; The first thing
he did was to go over the plain of Troy and all the scenes
described in the <i>Iliad</i>, and then to offer sacrifices at
the mound said to be the tomb of Achilles, while his chief friend
Heph&aelig;stion paid the same honours to Patroclus.</p>
<p>The best general in the Persian army was a Rhodian named
Memnon, who wanted to starve out Alexander by burning and
destroying all before him; but the satrap Arsaces would not
consent to this, and chose to collect his forces, and give battle
to the Greeks on the banks of the river Granicus, a stream rising
in Mount Ida and falling into the Euxine.&nbsp; Alexander led the
right wing, with a white plume in his helmet, so that all might
know him; Parmenio led the left; and it was a grand victory,
though not without much hard fighting, hand to hand.&nbsp;
Alexander was once in great danger, but was saved by Clitus, the
son of his nurse Lanika.&nbsp; <!-- page 225--><a
name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>The
Persians broke and dispersed so entirely that no army was left in

<p>Alexander forbade his troops to plunder the country, telling
them that it was his own, and that the people were as much his
subjects as they were; and all the difference he made was
changing the Persian governors for Greek ones.&nbsp; Sardis and
Ephesus fell into his hands without a blow; and to assist in
rebuilding the great <!-- page 226--><a name="page226"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 226</span>temple of Diana, he granted all the
tribute hitherto paid to the Great King.&nbsp; When he came to
Caria, Ada, who was reigning there as queen, adopted him as her
son, and wanted him to take all her best cooks with him to
provide his meals for the future.&nbsp; He thanked her, but said
his tutor had given him some far better relishers&mdash;namely, a
march before daybreak as sauce for his dinner, and a light dinner
as sauce for his supper.</p>
<p>When he came to Gordium, in Phrygia, where one version of the
story of Midas had placed that king, he was shown a waggon to
which the yoke was fastened by a knotted with of cornel bough,
and told that in this waggon Midas had come to Gordium, and that
whoever could undo it should be the lord of Asia.&nbsp; Alexander
dextrously drew out the pin, and unwound the knot, to the delight
of his followers.</p>
<p>In the spring he dashed down through the Taurus mountains, to
take possession of the city of Tarsus, in Cilicia, before Memnon
could collect the scattered Persian forces to enter it and cut
him off from Syria.&nbsp; He rode in heated and wearied, and at
once threw himself from his horse to bathe in the waters of the
river Cydnus; but they came from the melting snows of the
mountains, and were so exceedingly cold that the shock of the
chill brought on a most dangerous fever.&nbsp; One physician,
named Philip, offered to give him a draught that might relieve
him, but at the same time a warning was sent from Parmenio that
the man had been bribed to poison him.&nbsp; Alexander took the
cup, <!-- page 227--><a name="page227"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 227</span>and, while he drank it off, he held
out the letter to Philip with the other hand; but happily there
was no treason, and he slowly recovered, while Parmenio was sent
on to secure the mountain passes.&nbsp; Darius, however, was
advancing with a huge army, in which was a band of Spartans, who
hated the Persians less than they did the Macedonians.&nbsp; The
Persian march was a splendid sight.&nbsp; There was a crystal
disk to represent the sun over the king&rsquo;s tent, and the
army never moved till sunrise, when first were carried silver
altars bearing the sacred <!-- page 228--><a
name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>fire, and
followed by a band of youths, one for each day in the year, in
front of the chariot of the sun, drawn by white horses; after
which came a horse consecrated to the sun, and led by white-robed
attendants.&nbsp; The king himself sat in a high, richly-adorned
chariot, wearing a purple mantle, encrusted with precious stones,
and encompassed with his Immortal band, in robes adorned with
gold, and carrying silver-handled lances.&nbsp; In covered
chariots were his mother Sisygambis, his chief wife and her
children, and 360 inferior wives, their baggage occupying 600
mules and 300 camels, all protected by so enormous an army that
everyone thought the Macedonians must be crushed.</p>

</a></p>
<p>With some skill, Darius&rsquo; army passed from the East into
Cilicia, and thus got behind Alexander, who had gone two
days&rsquo; march into Syria; but on the tidings he turned back
at once, and found that they had not guarded the passes between
him and them.&nbsp; So he attacked them close to Issus, and there
again gained a great victory.&nbsp; When Darius saw his Immortals
giving way, he was seized with terror, sprang out of his royal
chariot, mounted on horseback, and never rested till he was on
the other side of the Euphrates.</p>
<p>Still there was a sharp fight, and Alexander was slightly
wounded in the thigh; but when all the battle was over he came to
the tents of Darius, and said he would try a Persian bath.&nbsp;
He was amused to find it a spacious curtained hall, full of
vessels of gold and silver, perfumes and ointments, of which the
simpler Greeks <!-- page 229--><a name="page229"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 229</span>did not even know the use, and with
a profusion of slaves to administer them.&nbsp; A Persian feast
was ready also; but just as he was going to sit down to it he
heard the voice of weeping and wailing in the next tent, and
learned that it came from Darius&rsquo; family.&nbsp; He rose at
once to go and comfort the old mother, Sisygambis, and went into
her tent with Heph&aelig;stion.&nbsp; Both were plainly dressed,
and Heph&aelig;stion was the taller, so that the old queen took
him for the king, and threw herself at his feet.&nbsp; When she
saw her mistake she was alarmed, but Alexander consoled her
gently by saying, &ldquo;Be not dismayed, mother; this is
Alexander&rsquo;s other self.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he continued to
treat her with more kindness and respect than she had ever met
with before, even from her own kindred; nor did he ever grieve
her but once, when he showed her a robe, spun, woven, and worked
by his mother and sisters for him, and offered to have her
grand-children taught to make the like.&nbsp; Persian princesses
thought it was dignified to have nothing to do, and Sisygambis
fancied he meant to make slaves of them; so that he had to
reassure her, and tell her that the distaff, loom, and needle
were held to give honour to Greek ladies.&nbsp; Darius had fled
beyond the rivers, and Alexander waited to follow till he should
have reduced the western part of the empire.&nbsp; He turned into
Syria and Ph&oelig;nicia, and laid siege to Tyre, which was built
on an island a little way from the sea-shore.&nbsp; He had no
ships, but he began building a causeway across the water.&nbsp;
However, the Tyrians sallied out and destroyed <!-- page 230--><a
name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>it; and he
had to go to Sidon, which he took much more easily, and thence
obtained ships, with which he beat the Tyrian fleet, and, after
great toil and danger, at last entered Tyre, after a siege of
five months.</p>
<p>Then he marched along the shore to the Philistine city of
Gaza, which was likewise most bravely defended by a black slave
named B&oelig;tis.&nbsp; Alexander was much hurt by a stone
launched from the walls, which struck him between the breast and
shoulder, and when at the end of four months&rsquo; siege the
city was stormed, the attack was led by one of his cousins.&nbsp;
A cruel slaughter was made of the citizens; and then Alexander
marched up the steep road to Jerusalem, expecting another tedious
siege.&nbsp; Instead of this, he beheld a long procession in
white bordered with blue, coming out at the gates to meet
him.&nbsp; All the Priests and Levites, in their robes, came
forth, headed by Jaddua, the High Priest, in his beautiful
raiment, and the golden mitre on his head inscribed with the
words, &ldquo;Holiness unto the Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; So he had been
commanded by God in a vision; and when Alexander beheld the
sight, he threw himself from his horse, and adored the Name on
the mitre.&nbsp; He told his officers that before he set out from
home, when he was considering of his journey, just such a form as
he now beheld had come and bidden him fear not, for he should be
led into the East, and all Persia should be delivered to
him.&nbsp; Then the High Priest took him to the outer court of
the temple, and showed him the very prophecies of Daniel and
Zechariah where his own conquests were foretold.</p>

<h2>CHAP. XXIX.&nbsp; ALEXANDER&rsquo;S EASTERN CONQUESTS.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 331&ndash;328.</h2>
<p>
<img class='dc' alt='A' title='A' src='images/dca.jpg'
/>lexander&rsquo;s next step was into Egypt, where the people had
long desired to drive out the Persians, and welcomed him
gladly.&nbsp; He wished to make a Greek settlement in Egypt, and
bring Greek and Egyptian learning together; so at the delta of
the Nile he built the great city of Alexandria, which still
remains as important as ever.</p>
<p>So powerful did he feel himself, that a fancy crossed his mind
that, after all, he was no mere man, but the son of Jupiter, and
a demi-god, like Bacchus, or Hercules of old.&nbsp; There was a
temple to the Egyptian god Ammon, on an oasis, a fertile spot
round a spring in the middle of the desert, with an oracle that
Alexander resolved to consult, and he made his way thither with a
small chosen band.&nbsp; The oasis was green with laurels and
palms; and the emblem of the god, a gold disk, adorned with
precious stones, and placed in a huge golden ship, was carried to
meet him by eighty priests, with maidens dancing round
them.&nbsp; He was taken alone <!-- page 232--><a
name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 232</span>to the
innermost shrine.&nbsp; What he heard there he never told; but
after this he wore rams&rsquo; horns on his helmet, because a
ram&rsquo;s head was one sign of the god, whom the Greeks made
out to be the same as Jupiter; and from this time forward he
became much more proud and puffed up, so that it is likely that
he had been told by this oracle just what pleased him.</p>
<p>He then went back to Tyre, and thence set out for the
East.&nbsp; A bridge was thrown across the Euphrates, but the
Tigris was forded by the foot soldiers, holding their shields
above their heads out of the water.&nbsp; On the other side
Darius was waiting with all the men of the East to fight for
their homes, not for distant possessions, as had been the lands
of Asia Minor, Syria, and Egypt.&nbsp; The Greeks had four
days&rsquo; march along the banks of the Tigris before coming in
sight of the Persian host at Arbela.&nbsp; It was so late that
the two armies slept in sight of one another.&nbsp; Parmenio
advised the king to make a night attack, but all the answer he
got was, &ldquo;It would be base to steal a victory;&rdquo; and
when he came in the morning to say that all was ready, he found
his master fast asleep, and asked him how he could rest so calmly
with one of the greatest battles in the world before him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How could we not be calm,&rdquo; replied Alexander,
&ldquo;since the enemy is coming to deliver himself into our
hands?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He would not wear such a corslet as had been crushed into his
shoulder at Gaza, but put on a breastplate of thick quilted
linen, girt with a broad leather <!-- page 233--><a
name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>belt,
guarded with a crust of finely-worked metal, and holding a light,
sharp sword.&nbsp; He had a polished steel helmet, a long spear
in his right hand, and a shield on his left arm; and thus he went
forth to meet Darius, who came in the midst of 200 chariots,
armed with scythes, and fifteen trained elephants.&nbsp; He had
so many troops that he intended to close the wings of his army in
upon the Greeks, fold them up, and cut them off; but Alexander,
foreseeing this, had warned his men to be ready to face about on
any side, and then drew them up in the shape of a wedge, and thus
broke into the very heart of the Immortal band, and was on the
point of taking Darius prisoner, when he was called off to help
Parmenio, whose division had been broken, so that the camp was
threatened.&nbsp; Alexander&rsquo;s presence soon set all right
again, and made the victory complete; but Darius had had time to
get away, and was galloping on a swift horse to the Armenian
mountains.&nbsp; There was nobody left to defend Assyria, and
Alexander marched in through the brazen gates of Babylon, when
the streets were strewn with flowers, and presents of lions and
leopards borne forth to greet the conqueror.</p>
<p>The great temple of Bel had been partly ruined by the
fire-worshipping Persians, and Alexander greatly pleased the
Babylonians by decreeing that they might restore it with his aid;
but the Jews at Babylon would not work at an idol temple, which
they believed to be also the tower of Babel, and on their
entreaty Alexander permitted them to have nothing to do with
it.</p>
<p><!-- page 234--><a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
234</span>After staying thirty days at Babylon, he went on to
Susa, where he found the brazen statues which Xerxes had carried
away from the sack of Athens.&nbsp; He sent them home again, to
show the Greeks that he had avenged their cause.&nbsp; When he
came to Fars&mdash;or, as the Greeks called it,
Persepolis&mdash;a wretched band of Greek captives came out to
meet him, with their eyes put out, or their noses, ears, hands,
or feet cut off.&nbsp; The Greeks never tortured: it was a
dreadful sight to them, and the king burst into tears, and
promised to send all safe home, but they begged him, instead, to
help them to live where they were, since they were ashamed to
show themselves to their kindred.&nbsp; Their misery made
Alexander decide on giving the city up to plunder; the men were
killed, the women and children made slaves.&nbsp; <!-- page
235--><a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>He
meant to revenge on the Persian capital all that the Great Kings
had inflicted on the Greek cities, and one Corinthian actually
shed tears of joy at seeing him on the throne, exclaiming,
&ldquo;What joy have those Greeks missed who have not seen
Alexander on the throne of Darius!&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>Poor Darius had pushed on into the mountains beyond Media, and
thither Alexander pursued him; but his own subjects had risen
against him, and placed him in a chariot bound with golden
chains.&nbsp; Alexander dashed on in pursuit with his fleetest
horsemen, riding all night, and only resting in the noonday heat,
for the last twenty-five miles over a desert without water.&nbsp;
At daybreak he saw the Persian host moving along like a confused
crowd.&nbsp; He charged them, and there was a general flight, and
presently a cry that Darius was taken.&nbsp; Alexander galloped
up and found the unhappy king on the ground, speechless and
dying, pierced with javelins by his own subjects, who would not
let him fall alive into the enemy&rsquo;s hands, and supported by
a Macedonian soldier, who had given him drink, and heard his
words of gratitude to Alexander for his kindness to his family,
and his hopes that the conqueror would avenge his death, and
become sovereign of the world.&nbsp; Alexander threw his own
mantle over the body, and caused it to be embalmed, and buried in
the sepulchres of the Persian kings.</p>
<p>Now that the victory was gained, the Greeks wanted to go home,
and keep all the empire subject to them; <!-- page 236--><a
name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>but this
was not Alexander&rsquo;s plan.&nbsp; He meant to spread Greek
wisdom and training over all the world, and to rule Persians as
well as Greeks for their own good.&nbsp; So, though he let the
Greek allies go home with pay, rewards, and honours, he kept his
Macedonians, and called himself by the Persian title, Shah in
Shah, King of Kings, crowned himself with the Persian crown, and
wore royal robes on state occasions.&nbsp; The Macedonians could
not bear the sight, especially the nobles, who had lived on
almost equal terms with him.&nbsp; There were murmurs, and
Parmenio was accused of being engaged in a plot, and put to
death.&nbsp; It was the first sad stain on Alexander&rsquo;s
life, and he fell into a fierce and angry mood, being fretted, as
it seems, by the murmurs of the Macedonians, and harassed by the
difficulties of the wild mountainous country on the borders of
Persia, where he had to hunt down the last Persians who held out
against him.&nbsp; At a town called Cyropolis, a stone thrown
from the walls struck him on the back of the neck, and for some
days after he could not see clearly, so that some harm had
probably been done to his brain.&nbsp; A few days later he was
foolish enough to indulge in a wine-drinking banquet, at which
some flatterers began to praise him in such an absurd manner that
Clitus, the son of his good foster-mother Lanika, broke out in
anger at his sitting still to listen to them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Listen
to truth,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;or else ask no freemen to join
you, but surround yourself with slaves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alexander, beside himself with rage, leaped up, <!-- page
237--><a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
237</span>feeling for his dagger to kill Clitus, but it was not
in his belt, and they were both dragged backwards and held by
their friends, until Alexander broke loose, snatched a pike from
a soldier, and laid Clitus dead at his feet; but the moment he
saw what he had done, he was hardly withheld from turning the
point against himself, and then he shut himself up in his chamber
and wept bitterly, without coming out or tasting food for three
days.&nbsp; He caused Clitus to be buried with all honours, and
offered great sacrifices to Bacchus, thinking that it was the
god&rsquo;s hatred that made him thus pass into frenzy when he
had been drinking wine.</p>
<p>He spent three years in securing his conquest over the Persian
empire, where he won the love of the natives by his justice and
kindness, and founded many cities, where he planted Greeks, and
tried to make schools and patterns for the country round.&nbsp;
They were almost all named Alexandria, and still bear the name,
altered in some shape or other; but though some of his nearer
friends loved him as heartily as ever, and many were proud of
him, or followed him for what they could get, a great many
Macedonians hated him for requiring them to set the example of
respect, and laughed at the Eastern forms of state with which he
was waited on, while they were still more angry that he made the
Persians their equals, and not their slaves.&nbsp; So that he had
more troubles with the Macedonians than with the strangers.</p>

<h2>CHAP. XXX.&mdash;THE END OF ALEXANDER.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">b.c.</span> 328.</h2>
<p>
<img class='dc' alt='B' title='B' src='images/dcb.jpg' />efore
establishing his empire, Alexander longed to survey the unknown
lands further eastwards, and he led his army down the long,
terrible Khybar pass to the banks of the Indus, where he fought a
great battle with an Indian king called Porus, the bravest enemy
he had yet met.&nbsp; At last Porus was defeated and made
prisoner.&nbsp; He came to Alexander as if he were visiting him,
and Alexander received him with like courtesy, and asked if he
had any request to make.&nbsp; &ldquo;None, save to be treated as
a king,&rdquo; said Porus.&nbsp; &ldquo;That I shall do, for my
own sake,&rdquo; said Alexander, and the two became
friends.&nbsp; In this country of the Indus, Alexander received
the submission of thirty-five cities, and founded two more, one
of which he named Bucephala, in honour of his good horse
Bucephalus, which died in the middle of a battle without a
wound.</p>
<p>Alexander longed to press on and see all the wonders of India,
and the great river Ganges, but his <!-- page 239--><a
name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>Macedonians
were weary of the march, and absolutely refused to go any
further, so that he was obliged to turn back, in hopes of
collecting another army, and going to the very shores of the
Eastern Ocean.</p>
<p>He would not, however, return by the way he had gone, through
the mountains, but he built ships on the river Jhelum, a
tributary of the Indus, with which to coast along the shores to
the mouth of the Euphrates.&nbsp; There were forests of fir and
pine to supply the wood, but their inhabitants, the apes and
monkeys, collected in such force on the top of a hill near at
hand, that the Greeks thought they were human enemies, and were
about to attack them, till a native explained the mistake.</p>
<p>They met more dangerous enemies when they came to Mooltan, the
city of a tribe called the Malli.&nbsp; This was a fort shut in
by a strong outer wall, within which trees were growing.&nbsp;
Alexander planted a ladder against the wall, and mounted it
first, but while his men were climbing up after him, it broke,
and he stood alone on the wall, a mark for all the darts of the
enemy.&nbsp; His guards stretched up their arms, begging him to
leap back to them, but he scorned to do this, and jumped down
within, among the enemy.&nbsp; They gave back for a moment, but,
on finding that he was quite alone, closed in upon him.&nbsp; He
set his back against the wall, under a fig-tree, and slew with
his sword all who approached.&nbsp; Then they formed into a
half-circle, and shot at him with barbed arrows, six feet
long.&nbsp; By this time a few <!-- page 240--><a
name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 240</span>of his
guards had climbed up the wall, and were coming down to his help,
at the moment when an arrow pierced his breast, and he sank down
in a kneeling posture, with his brow on the rim of his shield,
while his men held their shields over him till the rest could
come to their aid, and he was taken up as one dead, and carried
out on his shield, while all within the fort were slaughtered in
the rage of the Macedonians.&nbsp; When the king had been carried
to his tent, the point of the arrow was found to be firmly fixed
in his breast-bone, and he bade Perdiccas, his friend, cut a gash
wide enough to allow the barbs to pass before drawing it
out.&nbsp; He refused to be held while this was done, but kept
himself perfectly still, until he fainted, and lay for many hours
between life and death; nor was it for a week that he could even
bear to be placed on board a galley, and lie on the deck under an
awning as it went down the river, whilst his men were in raptures
to see him restored to them.</p>
<p>He had to halt for some weeks, and then proceed along the
Indus, until he reached the Indian Ocean, where the Greeks were
delighted to see their old friend the sea, though they were
amazed at the tides, having never seen any in their own
Mediterranean.&nbsp; Alexander now sent an old commander,
Nearchus, to take charge of the ships along the coast, while he
himself marched along inland, to collect provisions and dig wells
for their supply; but the dreadful, bare, waterless country,
covered with rocks, is so unfit for men that his troops <!-- page
241--><a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
241</span>suffered exceedingly, and hardly anyone has been there
since his time.&nbsp; He shared all the distresses of his
soldiers, and once, when a little water, found with great
difficulty, was brought him as he plodded along in the scorching
heat of a noonday sun, he gave heartfelt thanks, but in the sight
of all poured out the water, not choosing to take to himself what
all could not share.&nbsp; In the midst the guides lost their
way, and Alexander had to steer their course for a week by his
own instinct, and the sun and stars, until after sixty days he
reached a place which seems to be Bunpore, part of the Persian
empire, where his difficulties were over, and Nearchus by-and-by
joined him, after a wonderful voyage, of which he wrote an
account, which has not come down to our times, so that we only
know that no Greek believed in it.&nbsp; Alexander meant to try
if he could sail through this strange sea, and return to Greece
by the Pillars of Hercules, as we now know would have been quite
possible.</p>
<p>He found, when he came back to Persia, that the governors he
had left in the cities had thought that he was sure to perish in
India, and had plundered shamefully, so that he had to punish
severely both Greeks and Persians; but then, to make the two
nations friends, he held an immense wedding feast at Susa, when
eighty Greek bridegrooms married eighty Persian brides.&nbsp;
Alexander himself and his friend Heph&aelig;stion had the two
daughters of Darius, and the other ladies were daughters of
satraps.&nbsp; The wedding was thus <!-- page 242--><a
name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>conducted:
in one great hall eighty double seats were placed, and here the
bridegrooms sat down to feast, till the brides entered, in
jewelled turbans, wide linen drawers, silken tunics, and broad
belts.&nbsp; Alexander rose, took his princess by the hand, and
led her to his seat, and all the rest followed his
example&mdash;each led his lady to his seat, kissed her, and
placed her beside him, then cut a loaf of bread in two, poured
out wine, and ate and drank with her.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Heph&aelig;stion died soon after, at Ecbatana, of a fever he
had not taken care of in time.&nbsp; Alexander caused his corpse
to be brought to Babylon, and burnt on a funeral pile; while he
himself was in an agony of grief, and sent to ask the oracle of
Ammon whether his friend might not be worshipped as a
hero-god.&nbsp; He himself had already demanded divine honours
from the Greeks.&nbsp; The Athenians obeyed, but secretly mocked;
<!-- page 243--><a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
243</span>and the Spartans grimly answered, &ldquo;If Alexander
will be a god, let him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alexander was at Babylon, newly fortifying it, and preparing
it to be the capital of his mighty empire.&nbsp; He held his
court seated on the golden throne of the Persian Shahs, with a
golden pine over it, the leaves of emeralds and the fruit of
carbuncles; and here he received embassies from every known
people in Europe and Asia, and stood at the highest point of
glory that man has ever reached, not knowing how near the end
was.</p>
<p>Ever since Cyrus had taken Babylon by turning the Euphrates
out of its course, the ground had been ill drained, swampy, and
unhealthy; and before setting out on further conquests, Alexander
wished to put all this in order again, and went about in a boat
on the canals to give directions.&nbsp; His broad-brimmed hat was
blown off, and lodged among the weeping willows round some old
Assyrian&rsquo;s tomb; and though it was brought back at once,
the Greeks thought its having been on a tomb an evil omen, but
the real harm was in the heat of the sun on his bare head, which
he had shorn in mourning for Heph&aelig;stion.</p>
<p>He meant to go on an expedition to Arabia, and offered a great
sacrifice, but at night fever came on.&nbsp; The Greeks at home,
who hated him, said it was from drinking a huge cup of wine at
one draught; but this is almost certain not to be true, since his
doctors have left a daily journal of his illness, and make no
mention <!-- page 244--><a name="page244"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 244</span>of any such excess.&nbsp; He daily
grew worse, worn out by his toils and his wounds, and soon he
sank into a lethargy, in which he hardly spoke.&nbsp; Once he
said something about his empire passing to the strongest, and of
great strife at his funeral games, and at last, when his breath
was almost gone, he held out his signet ring to Perdiccas, the
only one of his old friends who was near him.&nbsp; He was only
thirty-three years old, and had made his mighty conquests in
twelve years, when he thus died in 323.&nbsp; The poor old
Persian queen, Sisygambis, so grieved for him that she refused
all food, sat weeping in a corner, and died a few days after
him.</p>

generals of Alexander met in dismay and grief the morning after
his death at Babylon, and Perdiccas sadly laid the ring on the
empty throne.&nbsp; There was no one to go on with what he had
begun, for though he had a brother named Arrid&aelig;us, the poor
youth was weak in mind; and Alexander&rsquo;s own son was a
little, helpless infant.&nbsp; These two were joined together as
Kings of Macedon and Shahs of Persia, and four guardians were
appointed for them, who really only used their names as a means
of getting power for themselves.</p>
<p>The Greek cities had always hated the yoke of Macedon, and
hoped that Alexander would be lost in the East.&nbsp; They had
been restless all this time, and had only been kept down by the
threats and the bribes of Antipater, the governor of
Macedon.&nbsp; When the news of Alexander&rsquo;s death first
came to Athens, the people were ready to make a great outbreak,
but the more cautious would not believe it, and Phocion advised
<!-- page 246--><a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
246</span>them to wait, &ldquo;for,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if he
is dead to-day, he will still be dead to-morrow and the next day,
so that we may take council at our leisure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phocion was a good and honest man, but low-spirited, and he
thought quiet the only hope for Athens.&nbsp; When he found that
the citizens were making a great boasting, and were ready to rush
into a war without counting the cost, he said he would advise one
only &ldquo;whenever he saw the young men ready to keep their
ranks, the old men to pay the money, and the orators to abstain
from taking it for themselves.&rdquo;&nbsp; However, the
Athenians made a league with the Thessalians and other Greeks
against Macedon, and put their army under the command of
Leosthenes, a young man to whom Phocion said, &ldquo;Your
speeches are like cypress trees, stately and lofty, but bearing
no fruit.&rdquo;&nbsp; Leosthenes defeated Antipater and the
Macedonians at Lamia, and besieged them; but still Phocion had no
hope, and when asked whether he could wish for better success, he
said, &ldquo;No, but better counsels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Demosthenes had in the meantime been banished by the spite of
some of his secret enemies.&nbsp; He was very angry and bitter,
and as he lived in &AElig;gina, whence he could still see the
Acropolis and temple of Pallas Athene, he exclaimed,
&ldquo;Goddess, what favourites thou halt chosen&mdash;the owl,
the ass, and the Athenians;&rdquo; but in these days of joy a
ship was sent by the State to bring him home, and fifty talents
were granted to him.</p>
<p>But Leosthenes was killed by a stone from the walls <!-- page
247--><a name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>of
Lamia, and some Macedonian troops came home from the East to the
help of Antipater.&nbsp; They were defeated by land, but they
beat the Athenians by sea; and in a second battle such a defeat
was given to the Greeks that their league against Macedon was
broken up, and each city was obliged to make peace for itself
separately.</p>

</a></p>
<p><!-- page 248--><a name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
248</span>Antipater made it a condition of granting peace that
all who had favoured resistance to Macedon should be treated as
rebels.&nbsp; Demosthenes and his friends fled from Athens, and
took refuge at the temples of different gods; but the cruel
Macedonian was resolved that they should all be put to death, and
took a set of ruffians into his pay, who were called the
Exile-hunters, because they were to search out and kill all who
had been sent away from their cities for urging them to free
themselves.&nbsp; Demosthenes was in the temple of Neptune at
Calaurea.&nbsp; When the exile-hunters came thither, he desired
time to write a letter to his friends, spread a roll of parchment
before him, and bit the top of the reed he was writing with;
after which he bowed his head, and covered it with his
robe.&nbsp; There was poison hidden in the top of the reed, and
presently he rose up and said, &ldquo;Act the part of Creon, and
throw my body to the dogs.&nbsp; I quit thy sanctuary, Neptune,
still breathing, though Antipater and the Macedonians have not
spared it from pollution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tried to reach the door, but as he passed the altar, fell,
and died with one groan.&nbsp; Poor Athens was quite struck down,
and the affairs were chiefly managed by Phocion, who was a
thoroughly honest, upright man, but submitted to let the
Macedonians dictate to the city, because he did not think the
Athenians could make head against them.&nbsp; Antipater could
never persuade him to take any reward for himself, though others
who were friends of Macedon could never be satisfied <!-- page
249--><a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
249</span>with bribes.&nbsp; Meantime, Perdiccas was coming home,
bringing with him the two young kings, uncle and nephew, and
meaning to put Antipater down; but he turned aside on his way to
attack Ptolemy, the ablest of all Alexander&rsquo;s generals, who
was commanding in Egypt, and in trying to cross the Nile a great
part of his army was cut off, and multitudes were eaten by the
crocodiles.&nbsp; The few who were left rose against him and
murdered him in his tent, then offered the command and
guardianship of the kings to Ptolemy; but he would not take it,
and chose rather to stay and make himself king of Egypt, where
his family reigned at Alexandria for three hundred years, all the
kings being called Ptolemy.</p>
<p>Antipater was by this time an old man, and he died a little
after; and his son Cassander expected to take the government of
Macedon, but, to his surprise, found that his father had
appointed the old general Polysperchon in his stead.&nbsp; This
he would not endure, and a war arose between the two.&nbsp; One
of Cassander&rsquo;s friends took possession of the Pir&aelig;us,
to hold it for him; and Phocion was accused of having advised it,
and was obliged to flee with his friends into a village in
Phocis, where they were made prisoners by Polysperchon, who
thought to please the Athenians by sending them in waggons to
Athens to be tried.&nbsp; A mob of the worst sort came together,
and would not hear their defence, but sentenced them to die by
taking hemlock.&nbsp; When Phocion was asked whether he had any
message for <!-- page 250--><a name="page250"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 250</span>his son, he said, &ldquo;Only that
he bear no grudge against the Athenians.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was
not enough hemlock to poison all, and more was sent for.&nbsp;
The jailer desired to be paid, and Phocion said, &ldquo;Give the
man his money.&nbsp; One cannot even die for nothing in
Athens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phocion is sometimes called the last of the Athenians, but it
was a sad kind of greatness, for he could not give them freedom,
and only tried to keep them from the misery of war by submission
to Macedon.&nbsp; The Spartans would give no help; and though the
little city of Megalopolis held bravely out against Cassander, it
was taken and horribly punished; and it was plain that the old
spirit of the Greeks was gone, and that they could no longer band
together to keep out the enemy; so they all remained in
subjection to Macedon, most of them with a garrison of Macedonian
soldiers in their citadel.&nbsp; But Athens was as full of
philosophers as ever, and became a sort of college, where people
sent their sons to study learning, oratory, and poetry, and hear
the disputes of the Stoic and Epicurean philosophers.</p>
<p>In the meantime Alexander&rsquo;s embalmed body had been
buried at Alexandria, and the two young kings, his son Alexander
&AElig;gos and his half-brother Arrid&aelig;us, had been brought
to Macedon.&nbsp; His mother Olympias put poor Arrid&aelig;us to
death as soon as she could get him into her power.&nbsp; She had
always hated Antipater, and now took part with Polysperchon
against Cassander; but this was the losing side.&nbsp;
Polysperchon was beaten, and driven out of Macedon: and she, with
her grandson <!-- page 251--><a name="page251"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 251</span>and his mother, the Persian princess
Roxana, shut themselves up in Pydna, where Cassander besieged
them till he had starved them out, and Olympias surrendered on
condition that her life was spared; but Cassander did not keep
his word, and sent soldiers to put her to death.&nbsp; The young
king and his mother were kept at Amphipolis till the boy was
sixteen years old; and then, growing afraid that he would try to
win his father&rsquo;s throne, Cassander had them both slain.</p>
<p>So the great empire of Alexander was broken up among four
chief powers, Cassander in Macedon, Lysimachus in Thrace,
Seleucus in Syria, Ptolemy in Egypt.</p>

<p>
<img class='dc' alt='T' title='T' src='images/dct.jpg' />here was
a mighty power coming up against Cassander.&nbsp; One of
Alexander&rsquo;s old generals, named Antigonus, the
&ldquo;One-eyed,&rdquo; had received some Asiatic provinces for
his share in the break-up of the empire, and when Perdiccas set
out on his return was appointed commander in his stead in the
East; and again, when Antipater died, Polysperchon renewed his
appointment; while Eumenes, an honest and good man, was the
regent upheld by Cassander&rsquo;s party.&nbsp; In 316 a battle
was fought at Gabiene, in which Eumenes was defeated.&nbsp; He
was given up to Antigonus by his own troops, and as the victor
could not bear to kill his old comrade, he left him in prison to
be starved to death.</p>
<p>Then Antigonus took possession of all the treasures in
Ecbatana and Babylon, and began to call Seleucus in Syria to
account for his dealings with the revenues of the empire.&nbsp;
Seleucus fled into Egypt; and all the four chiefs, Ptolemy,
Seleucus, Lysimachus, and Cassander joined together to put down
Antigonus and his <!-- page 253--><a name="page253"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 253</span>brave and able son, Demetrius.&nbsp;
There was war everywhere, until in 311 peace was made, on
condition that the Greek cities should be set free, and that
Antigonus should have the whole government of Asia Minor,
Seleucus of Syria, Ptolemy of Egypt, Cassander of Macedon, and
Lysimachus of Thrace, till the young Alexander was old enough to
govern; but, as we have seen, Cassander murdered him when he was
only sixteen, and the old family of Macedon was at an end.&nbsp;
Nor did Cassander give up the Greek cities; so Demetrius was sent
to force him to do so.&nbsp; There was little attempt to resist
him; and the Athenians were in such delight that they called him
the Saviour, named a month after him, lodged him in the Parthenon
itself, and caused his image to be carried in processions among
those of the gods themselves.&nbsp; He took so many towns that
his name in history is Poliorketes, or the City-taker, and then
he was sent to gain the isle of Cyprus from Ptolemy.&nbsp; The
fleet of Alexandria was thought the best in the world, but
Demetrius defeated it entirely in the year 306, and in their joy
the soldiers called him and his father both kings, and they put
on the diadem of the Shahs of Persia, making their capital the
city they had founded on the Orontes, and calling it
Antigoneia.</p>
<p>Cassander, Ptolemy, Lysimachus, and Seleucus all likewise
called themselves kings.&nbsp; And still the war went on.&nbsp;
Demetrius was sent against the island of Rhodes, which belonged
to Ptolemy, and besieged the <!-- page 254--><a
name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>city a
whole year, but could not take it, and was obliged to make peace
with the islanders at last, and to give them all the machines he
had used in the siege.&nbsp; These they sold for 300 talents, and
used the money to make an enormous brazen statue of Apollo, to
stand with one foot on each side of the entrance of the
harbour.&nbsp; Ships in full sail could pass under it, and few
men could grasp its thumb with their arms.&nbsp; It was called
the Colossus of Rhodes, and was counted as the seventh wonder of
the world, the others being the Temple of Diana at Ephesus, the
Tomb of Mausolus, the Lighthouse of Messina, the Walls of
Babylon, the Labyrinth of Crete, and the Pyramids of Egypt.&nbsp;
They also consecrated a grove to Ptolemy for the assistance he
had given to them.</p>
<p>Demetrius then went to Greece, and tried to overthrow
Cassander, but the other kings joined against him, and he was
obliged to go home, for Seleucus was threatening
Antigoneia.&nbsp; Antigonus and Demetrius collected their forces,
and fought a great battle at Ipsus, where Seleucus brought
trained elephants from India, which had lately begun to be used
in battle, and were found to frighten horses so as to render them
quite unmanageable.&nbsp; Demetrius, however, thought he had
gained the victory, but he rushed on too fast, and left his
father unsupported, so that poor old Antigonus, who was eighty
years of age, was shut in by the troops of Seleucus and
killed.&nbsp; Demetrius had to retreat to Ephesus with his broken
army.</p>
<p>The Athenians, who had made so much of him <!-- page 255--><a
name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>before, now
turned against him, and made a law to punish with death anyone
who should speak of making peace with him.&nbsp; However,
Cassander died, and his sons quarrelled about the kingdom, so
that Demetrius found it a good opportunity to return to Greece,
and very soon made the Athenians open their gates to him, which
they did in fear and trembling; but he treated them so mercifully
that they soon admired him as much as ever.</p>
<p>
<a href="images/p255.jpg">
<img class="floatright" alt=

src="images/p255.jpg" />
</a>Then he attacked Sparta, and defeated her king, taking the
city which had so long held out against the Macedonians; but he
had only just done so when he heard that Ptolemy had recovered
all Cyprus except Salamina, and that Lysimachus had seized all
Asia Minor, so that nothing was left to him but his army.</p>
<p>But there was a wonderful change still to befall him.&nbsp;
Cassander&rsquo;s sons,&mdash;as has been said, were disputing
for the kingdom.&nbsp; Their mother, Thessalonica, a daughter of
Philip of Macedon, favoured the youngest, and this so enraged the
eldest that he killed her with his own hand.&nbsp; His brother
called on Demetrius to help him, and he came with his army; but
on some fancy that the <!-- page 256--><a
name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 256</span>youth was
plotting against him, he had him put to death, and convinced the
Macedonians that the act was just.&nbsp; They would not have the
murderer of his own mother as their king, but chose Demetrius
himself to be king of Macedon, so that almost at the same time he
lost one kingdom and gained another, and this last remained in
his family for several generations.&nbsp; He tried to regain
Asia, but did not succeed; indeed he was once again obliged to
fly from Macedonia in disguise.&nbsp; He had learned to admire
the splendours of the East, wore a double diadem on his head, and
wonderful sandals; and he had also ordered skilful weavers and
embroiderers to make him a mantle, on which the system of the
universe as then understood&mdash;the earth in the centre, with
the moon, sun, and planets, and every fixed star then
discovered&mdash;was to be embroidered in gold.</p>
<p>The Macedonians had not been used to see their kings crowned
at all, or differently dressed from themselves, and they had
hardly borne such assumption of state from Alexander himself, in
the height of his pomp and glory, and when he had newly taken the
throne of the kings of Persia; and they were much offended at
Demetrius&rsquo; splendour, and still more at his pride and
haughtiness of manner, and inattention to those who had to make
any request from him.</p>
<p>One day, when he was passing through the streets, some persons
brought him some petitions, which he received more graciously
than usual, and placed them in one of the folds of his robe; but
as soon as he came <!-- page 257--><a name="page257"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 257</span>to a bridge over a river he threw
them into the water, to the great offence and disappointment of
the poor people who had brought them.</p>
<p>This was very unlike Ptolemy, who was a wise, clear-headed
man, with much of Alexander&rsquo;s spirit of teaching and
improving people under him, and who ruled so as to make himself
much beloved in Egypt, Cyprus, Rhodes, and Palestine.&nbsp; The
new city of Alexandria was his capital, and under him and his son
Ptolemy Philadelphus it grew to be a great merchant city, and
also a school of art, science, and philosophy almost as famous as
Athens, and with a library containing all the chief books in the
world, including the Old Testament.&nbsp; This was translated
into Greek by 70 learned Jews, and therefore called the
Septuagint.</p>
<p>Seleucus, king of Syria, held all the lands from Persia to
Asia Minor.&nbsp; His capital was Antioch, in Syria, which he had
built and named after his son Antiochus, and which became a very
splendid and beautiful city, full of a light-minded, merry
people, fond of games and shows.&nbsp; He built many other
places, calling them after himself or his son, and placing Greeks
to live in them.&nbsp; Thus, though Alexander only reigned twelve
years, he had made a great difference to the world, for the Greek
language, learning, and habits were spread all over the East, and
every well-taught person was brought up in them.&nbsp; So that,
while the grand old Greek states were in bondage, and produced no
more great men, their teachings had spread farther than they ever
thought.</p>

<h2>CHAP. XXXIII&mdash;PYRRHUS, KING OF EPIRUS.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">b.c.</span> 287.</h2>
<p>
<img class='dc' alt='T' title='T' src='images/dct.jpg' />o the
westward of Greece lay a mountainous land, bordered by the
Adriatic Sea, and in old times called Epirus.&nbsp; The people
spoke a sort of barbarous Greek, worse than that of the
Macedonians; but the royal family were pure Greeks, and believed
themselves to be descended from Achilles; and Alexander&rsquo;s
mother, Olympias, had been one of them.&nbsp; In the wars and
confusion that followed upon Alexander&rsquo;s death, the Epirot
king, &AElig;acides, took part, and this led to a rising against
him, ending in his being killed, with all his family, except his
little two-year-old son, named Pyrrhus, who was saved by some
faithful servants.&nbsp; They fled towards the city of Megara, on
the border of Macedon, but they only reached it late at night,
and there was a rough and rapid river between, swelled by
rains.&nbsp; They called to the people on the other side, and
held up the little child, but the rushing of the river drowned
their voices, and their words were not understood.&nbsp; At last
one of them peeled off a piece of bark <!-- page 259--><a
name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 259</span>from an oak
tree, and scratched on it with the tongue of a buckle an account
of their distress, and, fastening it to a stone, threw it
over.&nbsp; The Megarians immediately made a sort of raft with
trees, and, floating over, brought little Pyrrhus and his friends
across; but finding Macedon not safe, since Cassander had been
the enemy of &AElig;acides, they went on to Illyria, where they
found the king, Glaucias, sitting with his queen.&nbsp; Putting
the child on the ground, they began to tell their story.&nbsp; At
first the king was unwilling to grant him shelter, being afraid
of Cassander; but the little fellow, crawling about, presently
came near, and, laying hold of his leg, pulled himself upon his
feet, and looked up in his face.&nbsp; The pretty, unconscious
action of a suppliant so moved Glaucias that he took him up in
his arms, and gave him into those of the queen, bidding her have
him bred up among their own children; and though Cassander
offered 200 talents, he would not give up the boy.</p>
<p>When Pyrrhus was twelve years old, Glaucias sent an army to
restore him to his throne, and guarded him there.&nbsp; He was
high-spirited, brave, and gracious, but remarkable-looking, from
his upper teeth being all in one, without divisions.&nbsp; When
he was seventeen, while he was gone to Illyria to the wedding of
one of Glaucias&rsquo; sons, his subjects rose against him, and
made one of his cousins king.&nbsp; He then went to Demetrius,
who had married his elder sister, and fought under him at the
battle of Ipsus; after which Demetrius sent him as a hostage to
Alexandria, and his grace and spirit <!-- page 260--><a
name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 260</span>made him so
great a favourite with Ptolemy that he gave him his step-daughter
Berenice in marriage, and helped him to raise an army with which
he recovered his kingdom of Epirus.</p>
<p>He had not long been settled there before the Macedonians, who
had begun to hate Demetrius, heard such accounts of
Pyrrhus&rsquo; kindness as a man and skill as a warrior, that the
next time a war broke out they all deserted Demetrius, who was
forced to fly in the disguise of a common soldier, and his wife
poisoned herself in despair.&nbsp; However, Demetrius did not
lose courage, but left his son Antigonus to protect Greece, and
went into Asia Minor, hoping to win back some of his
father&rsquo;s old kingdom from Seleucus, but he could get nobody
to join him; and after wandering about in hunger and distress in
the Cilician mountains, he was forced to give himself up a
prisoner to Seleucus, who kept him in captivity, but treated him
kindly, and let him hunt in the royal park.&nbsp; His son
Antigonus, however, who still held Greece, wrote to offer himself
as a hostage, that his father might be set free; but before he
could reach Syria, Demetrius the City-taker had died of
over-eating and drinking in his captivity, and only the urn
containing his ashes could be sent to his son in Greece.</p>
<p>Pyrrhus had not kept Macedon long, for Lysimachus attacked
him, and the fickle Macedonians all went over to the Thracian, so
that he was obliged to retreat into his own kingdom of Epirus;
whilst Seleucus and <!-- page 261--><a name="page261"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 261</span>Lysimachus began a war, in which
Lysimachus was killed; and thus both Thrace and Macedon were in
the hands of Seleucus, who is therefore commonly called the
Conqueror.&nbsp; He was the last survivor of all
Alexander&rsquo;s generals, and held all his empire except Egypt;
but while taking possession of Macedonia he was murdered by a
vile Egyptian Greek, whom he had befriended, named Ptolemy
Keraunus.&nbsp; This man, in the confusion that followed, managed
to make himself king of Macedon.</p>
<p>But just at this time the Kelts, or Gauls, the same race who
used to dwell in Britain and Gaul, made one of their great
inroads from the mountains.&nbsp; The Macedonians thought them
mere savages, easy to conquer; but it turned out quite
otherwise.&nbsp; The Kelts defeated them entirely, cut off
Ptolemy Keraunus&rsquo; head, and carried it about upon a pole,
and overran all Thrace and Macedon.&nbsp; Then they advanced to
the Pass of Thermopyl&aelig;, found the way over Mount &OElig;ta
by which Xerxes had surprised the Spartans, and were about to
plunder Delphi, their Bran, or chief, being reported to say that
the gods did not want riches as much as men did.&nbsp; The
Greeks, in much grief for their beloved sanctuary, assembled to
fight for it, and they were aided by a terrible storm and
earthquake, which dismayed the Gauls, so that the next morning
they were in a dispirited state, and could not stand against the
Greeks.&nbsp; The Bran was wounded, and finding that the battle
was lost, called the other chiefs round him, advised <!-- page
262--><a name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
262</span>them to kill all the wounded men, and make their
retreat as best they might, and then stabbed himself to set the
example.&nbsp; The others tried to retreat, but were set upon by
the Greeks, tormented, and starved; and it is said that all who
had marched to Delphi perished, and the only Gauls of all this
host who survived were a party who had crossed the Hellespont,
and made a settlement in the very heart of Asia Minor, where they
were known by the name of Galatians, and still kept up their own
language.</p>

263</span>When they had thus cut off Keraunus, Antigonus came
from Greece, and took possession of Macedon.&nbsp; He made a
treaty with Antiochus, who had succeeded his father Seleucus in
Syria, and thenceforth the family founded by Antigonus the
One-eyed held Macedon.&nbsp; This Antigonus is called Gonatas,
from the name of a guard for the knee which he wore.</p>
<p>Pyrrhus, in the meantime, set out on a wild expedition to help
the Greek colonies in Italy against the Romans, hoping to make
himself as famous in the West as Alexander had done in the East;
but the story of his doings there belongs to the history of Rome,
so that I will leave it.&nbsp; He was absent six years, and came
home unsuccessful to harass Antigonus again.&nbsp; For a few
years the Macedonians again went over to Pyrrhus, and he tried to
conquer Greece, marching against Sparta with 25,000 men, 2000
horse, and 24 elephants.&nbsp; He assaulted the city, but Spartan
bravery was still enough to beat him off twice.&nbsp; However, he
wintered in the Peloponnesus, and in the spring attacked the city
of Argos, which was watched over by Antigonus, with his army, on
a hill near at hand.&nbsp; Pyrrhus had shown himself so skilful a
general that Antigonus would not fight a battle with him, and at
night some traitors invited Pyrrhus into Argos, with some of his
troops; but another party admitted Antigonus&rsquo; son and his
forces.&nbsp; In the morning Pyrrhus saw how he had been caught,
and sent a message to his son Helenus outside to break down part
of the wall, that he might retreat; <!-- page 264--><a
name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 264</span>but there
was some blunder in the message, and Helenus thought he was to
come in to help his father, so his men going in and
Pyrrhus&rsquo; going out met in the gateway and choked it.&nbsp;
Matters were made worse by one of the elephants falling down and
blocking up the street, while another went mad, and ran about
trampling down the crowd and trumpeting.&nbsp; Pyrrhus kept in
the rear, trying to guard his men through the streets, when an
Argive slightly wounded him, and as he was rushing to revenge the
blow, the mother of the man, who was looking down from her window
above, threw down a tile, hoping to save him, and struck Pyrrhus
on the back of the neck.&nbsp; He fell down stunned, and a
soldier cut off his head, and carried it to Antigonus, who turned
away in tears at the sight of this sad remnant of the ablest
captain in Greece, and caused Pyrrhus&rsquo; body to be
honourably buried in the temple of Ceres.&nbsp; Pyrrhus was only
forty-six years old when he was thus slain in the year 272.</p>
<p>There is a story of a conversation between Pyrrhus and a
philosopher named Kineas, just as he was setting off for
Italy.&nbsp; &ldquo;What shall you do with these men?&rdquo;
asked Kineas.&nbsp; &ldquo;Overcome Italy and Rome,&rdquo; said
Pyrrhus.&nbsp; &ldquo;And what next?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then
Sicily will be easily conquered.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Is that
all?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh no; Carthage and Lybia may be subdued
next.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And then?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then we
may secure Macedon and Greece.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And
then?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then we may eat and drink and
discourse.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And pray,&rdquo; said Kineas,
&ldquo;why should we not do so at once?&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAP. XXXIV.&nbsp; ARATUS AND THE ACHAIAN LEAGUE.&nbsp; <span

<p>
<img class='dc' alt='A' title='A' src='images/dca.jpg' />ntigonus
Gonatas was now quite the most powerful person left in Macedon or
Greece, and though Sparta and Athens tried to get the help of
Egypt against him, they could do nothing to shake off his
power.</p>
<p>There were twelve little cities in the Peloponnesus, which
were all united together in one league, called the Achaian, each
governing itself, but all joining together against any enemy
outside.&nbsp; In the good old times they had sent men to the
wars as allies of Sparta, but they had never had a man of much
mark among them.&nbsp; In the evil times, Sicyon, a city near
Achaia, fell under the power of a tyrant, and about the time that
Pyrrhus was killed, Clinias, a citizen of Sicyon, made a great
attempt to free his townsmen, but he was found out, his house
attacked, and he and his family all put to death, except his son
Aratus, a little boy of seven years old, who ran away from the
dreadful sight, and went wandering about the town, till by chance
he came into <!-- page 266--><a name="page266"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 266</span>the house of the tyrant&rsquo;s
sister.&nbsp; She took pity on the poor boy, hid him from her
brother all day, and at night sent him to Argos to some friends
of his father, by whom he was brought up.</p>
<p>When he was only twenty he wrote to friends at Sicyon, and
finding them of the same mind with himself, he climbed the walls
at night and met them.&nbsp; The people gathered round him, and
he caused it to be proclaimed with a loud voice, &ldquo;Aratus,
the son of Clinias, calls on Sicyon to resume her
liberty.&rdquo;&nbsp; The people all began rushing to the
tyrant&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; He fled by an underground passage,
and his house was set on fire, but not one person on either side
was killed or wounded.&nbsp; Aratus was resolved to keep Sicyon
free, and in order to make her strong enough, he persuaded the
citizens to join her to the Achaian League; and he soon became
the leading man among all the Achaians, and his example made
other cities come into the same band of union.&nbsp; He further
tried to gain strength by an alliance with Egypt, and he went
thither to see Ptolemy III., called Euergetes, or the
Benefactor.&nbsp; It is said that Ptolemy&rsquo;s good-will was
won by Aratus&rsquo; love of art, and especially of
pictures.&nbsp; Apelles, the greatest Grecian painter, was then
living, and had taken a portrait of one of the tyrants of
Sicyon.&nbsp; Aratus had destroyed all their likenesses, and he
stood a long time looking at this one before he could bring
himself to condemn it, but at last he made up his mind that it
must not be spared.&nbsp; Ptolemy liked him so <!-- page 267--><a
name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 267</span>much that
he granted him 150 talents for the city, and the Achaians were so
much pleased that they twice elected him their general, and the
second time he did them a great service.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>In the middle of the Isthmus of Corinth stood the city, and in
the midst was a fort called Acro-Corinthus, perched on a high
hill in the very centre of the city, so that whoever held it was
master of all to the south, and old Philip of Macedon used to
call it the Corinthian shackles of Greece.&nbsp; The king of
Macedon, Antigonus III., now held it; but Aratus devised a scheme
to take it.&nbsp; A Corinthian named Erginus had come to Sicyon
on business, and there met a friend of Aratus, to whom he chanced
to mention that there was <!-- page 268--><a
name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 268</span>a narrow
path leading up to the Acro-Corinthus at a place where the wall
was low.&nbsp; Aratus heard of this, and promised Erginus sixty
talents if he would guide him to the spot; but as he had not the
money, he placed all his gold and silver plate and his
wife&rsquo;s jewels in pledge for the amount.</p>
<p>On the appointed night Aratus came with 400 men, carrying
scaling-ladders, and placed them in the temple of Juno, outside
the city, where they all sat down and took off their shoes.&nbsp;
A heavy fog came on, and entirely hid them; and Aratus, with 100
picked men, came to the rock at the foot of the city wall, and
there waited while Erginus and seven others, dressed as
travellers, went to the gates and killed the sentinel and guard,
without an alarm.&nbsp; Then the ladders were fixed, and Aratus
came up with his men, and stood under the wall unseen, while four
men with lights passed by them.&nbsp; Three of these they killed,
but the fourth escaped, and gave the alarm.&nbsp; The trumpets
were sounded, and every street was full of lights and swarmed
with men; but Aratus, meantime, was trying to climb the steep
rocks, and groping for the path leading up to the citadel.&nbsp;
Happily the fog lifted for a moment, the moon shone out, and he
saw his way, and hastened up to the Acro-Corinthus, where he
began to fight with the astonished garrison.&nbsp; The 300 men
whom he had left in the temple of Juno heard the noise in the
city and saw the lights, then marched in and came to the foot of
the rock, but not being able to find <!-- page 269--><a
name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 269</span>the path,
they drew up at the foot of a precipice, sheltered by an
overhanging rock, and there waited in much anxiety, hearing the
battle overhead, but not able to join in it.&nbsp; The Macedonian
governor, in the meantime, had called out his men, and was going
up to support the guard in the fort, blowing his trumpets, when,
as he passed these men, they dashed out on him, just as if they
had been put in ambush on purpose, and so dismayed them in the
confusion that they fancied the enemy five times as many, as the
moon and the <!-- page 270--><a name="page270"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 270</span>torches flashed on their armour, and
they let themselves all be made prisoners.</p>

</a></p>
<p>By the time morning had come Corinth was in the hands of the
Achaians, and Aratus came down from the fortress to meet the
people in the theatre.&nbsp; His 400 men were drawn up in two
lines at its entrances, and the Corinthians filled the seats, and
shouted with an ecstasy of joy, for it was the first time for
nearly a century that true Greeks had gained any advantage over
Macedonians.&nbsp; Aratus was worn out by anxiety, his long
march, and night of fighting, and as he stood leaning on his
spear he could hardly rally strength to address them, and while
giving back to them the keys of their city, which they had never
had since Philip&rsquo;s time, he exhorted them to join the
League, which they did.&nbsp; The Macedonians were expelled, and
Aratus put an Achaian garrison into the Acro-Corinthus.</p>
<p>His whole care was to get Greece free from the Macedonians,
and he drove them out from city after city, persuading each to
join the Achaian League as it was delivered.&nbsp; Argos was
still under a tyrant named Aristippus, and Aratus made many
attempts to turn him out, by his usual fashion of night
attacks.&nbsp; Once he got into the city, and fought there all
day, though he was wounded with a lance in the thigh; but he was
obliged to retreat at night.&nbsp; However, he attacked the
tyrant when out on an expedition, and slew him, but still could
not set Argos free, as the tyrant&rsquo;s son Aristomenes still
held it.</p>
<p><!-- page 271--><a name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
271</span>However, Lysiades, the tyrant of Megalopolis, was so
moved by admiration for the patriot that he resigned, and the
city joined the League.&nbsp; In fact, Aratus was at this time
quite the greatest man in Greece.&nbsp; He beat the
&AElig;tolians, when they were on a foray into the Achaian
territories, and forced them to make peace; and he tried also to
win Athens and Sparta to the common cause against Macedon, but
there were jealousies in the way that hindered his success, and
all his enterprises were rendered more difficult by his weakly
health, which always made him suffer greatly from the fatigue and
excitement of a battle.</p>

had never been so overcome by Macedon as the states north of the
Isthmus, but all the discipline of Lycurgus had been forgotten,
and the Ephors and Kings had become greedy, idle, and
corrupt.&nbsp; One of the kings, named Leonidas, had gone to
Antioch, married an Eastern wife, and learned all the Syrian and
Persian vanities in which King Seleucus delighted, and he brought
these home to Sparta.&nbsp; The other king, Eudamidas, was such a
miser, that on his death, in 244, his widow and his mother were
said to possess more gold than all the rest of the people in the
state put together; but he left a son of nineteen, named Agis,
most unlike himself.</p>
<p>As soon as, in his childhood, Agis had heard the story of his
great forefathers, he set himself to live like an ancient
Spartan, giving up whatever Lycurgus had forbidden, dressing and
eating as plainly as he could, and always saying that he would
not be king if he did <!-- page 273--><a name="page273"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 273</span>not hope to make Sparta her true
self again.&nbsp; When he became king, he was seen in the usual
dress of a Greek, uncrowned, as the first Leonidas and Agesilaus
had been; while the other king, ill named Leonidas, moved about
in a diadem and purple robes and jewels, like a Persian Shah.</p>
<p>
<a href="images/p273.jpg">
<img class="floatright" alt=
"Greek figure"
title=
"Greek figure"
src="images/p273.jpg" />
</a>Agis was resolved to bring back all the old rule.&nbsp; There
were but 700 old Dorian Spartans left, and only about 100 of
these still had their family estates, while the others were
starving; and most of the property was in the hands of
women.&nbsp; Therefore the young king was resolved to have all
given up and divided again, and he prevailed on his mother and
grandmother to throw all their wealth into the common stock, as
also his mother&rsquo;s brother Agesilaus, who was willing,
because he was so much in debt that he could hardly lose by any
change.&nbsp; The other ladies made a great outcry, and Leonidas
was very angry, but he did not dare to hinder all this, because
all the high-born men, who had been so poor, were on the young
king&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>So there was a public assembly, and one of the Ephors proposed
the reform, showing how ease and <!-- page 274--><a
name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 274</span>pleasure
had brought their city low, and how hardihood and courage might
yet bring back her true greatness.&nbsp; Leonidas spoke against
the changes, but Agis argued with such fire and force that he won
over all that were high-minded enough to understand him, and in
especial Cleombrotus, the son-in-law of Leonidas.&nbsp; Agis laid
down before the assembly all his father&rsquo;s vast hoards, and
his example was followed by many; but the other king put such
difficulties in the way that the reformers found that they could
do nothing unless they removed him, so they brought forward an
old law, which forbade that any son of Hercules should reign who
had married a foreign woman, or sojourned in a strange land.</p>
<p>On hearing of this, Leonidas took refuge in the temple of
Athene, and as he did not appear when he was summoned before the
Ephors, they deposed him, and named Cleombrotus in his stead; but
when Agis found there was a plan for killing the old king, he
took care to send him away in safety to Tegea, with his daughter
Chilonis, who clave to him in trouble.</p>
<p>Agis thought his uncle Agesilaus was heartily with the change,
and so had him chosen one of the Ephors; but, in truth, all
Agesilaus wanted was to be free from his debts, and he persuaded
the young king that the lands could not be freshly divided till
all debts had been cancelled.&nbsp; So all the bonds were brought
into the market-place and burnt, while Agesilaus cried out <!--
page 275--><a name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
275</span>that he had never seen so fine a fire; but having done
this, he was resolved not to part with his wealth, and delayed
till the &AElig;tolians made an attack on the Peloponnesus, and
Aratus called on Sparta to assist the Achaians.&nbsp; Agis was
sent at the head of an army to the Isthmus, and there behaved
like an ancient Spartan king, sharing all the toils and hardships
of the soldiers, and wearing nothing to distinguish him from
them; but while he was away everything had gone wrong at Sparta;
people had gone back to their old bad habits, and Agesilaus was
using his office of Ephor so shamefully that he had been obliged
to have a guard of soldiers to protect him from the people.&nbsp;
This behaviour had made the people suspect his nephew of being
dishonest in his reforms, and they had sent to recall
Leonidas.</p>
<p>Agesilaus fled, and Agis was obliged to take sanctuary in
Athene&rsquo;s temple, and Cleombrotus in that of Neptune, where
Leonidas found him.&nbsp; His wife Chilonis, with her two little
children, threw herself between him and her father, pleading for
his life, and promising he should leave the city; and Leonidas
listened, trying to make her remain, but she clung to her
husband, and went into exile with him.</p>
<p>Agiatis, the young wife of Agis, could not join him in the
temple, being kept at home by the birth of her first babe.&nbsp;
He never left the sanctuary, except to go to the baths, to which
he was guarded by armed friends.&nbsp; At last two of these were
bribed to betray him.&nbsp; One <!-- page 276--><a
name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 276</span>said,
&ldquo;Agis, I must take you to the Ephors,&rdquo; and the other
threw a cloak over his head; while Leonidas came up with a guard
of foreign soldiers and dragged him to prison, where the Ephors
came to examine him.&nbsp; One asked him if he repented.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I can never repent of virtue,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>They sentenced him to die; and finding that his mother and
grandmother were trying to stir up the people to demand that he
should be heard in public, they sent the executioners at once to
put him to death.&nbsp; One of them came in tears, but Agis
quickly said, &ldquo;Weep not, friend; I am happier than those
who condemn me;&rdquo; and he held out his neck for the rope
which strangled him just as his grandmother and mother came
in.&nbsp; The grandmother was strangled the next moment.&nbsp;
The mother said, &ldquo;May this be for the good of
Sparta,&rdquo; and after laying out the limbs of her son and
mother, was also put to death; and the young widow Agiatis, with
her babe, was carried to the house of Leonidas.&nbsp; The reform
of Agis had lasted only three years, and he was but twenty-two,
when his plans were thus cruelly cut short.</p>
<p>Leonidas was thus left to reign alone, the first time such a
thing had happened in Sparta.&nbsp; As poor Agiatis was a rich
heiress, he kept her in his house, and married her to his son
Cleomenes, a mere boy, much younger than herself.&nbsp; She was
the fairest and wisest woman in Greece; and though she always was
cold, grave, and stern towards the wicked old king, she loved his
wife, <!-- page 277--><a name="page277"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 277</span>and was gentle towards the young
boy, who was blameless of his father&rsquo;s sin, and gave her
all his heart for his whole life.&nbsp; He cared for nothing so
much as to hear from her of Agis, his brave, self-denying ways,
and noble plans; and thus did they live, after the untimely death
of Agis, strengthened by the study of the Stoic philosophy, which
taught that virtue was the highest good, and that no suffering,
not even death, was to be shunned in pursuit of her.</p>
<p>When Leonidas died, in 236, Cleomenes became the only king,
but he was so young that Aratus and the Achaians thought it a
good time for extending the power of their league at the expense
of Sparta; so, though no war was going on, Aratus sent a troop by
night to seize Tegea and Orchomenus, cities in alliance with
Sparta.&nbsp; But his designs were found out in time for
Cleomenes to strengthen the garrisons in both places, and march
himself to a place called the Athen&aelig;um, which guarded one
of the passes into Laconia.</p>
<p>This made the attempt fail, and Cleomenes wrote to ask the
cause of the night march of the Achaians.&nbsp; Aratus answered
that it was to hinder the fortification of the
Athen&aelig;um.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the use, then, of torches and
scaling-ladders?&rdquo; asked Cleomenes.</p>
<p>Aratus laughed, and asked a Spartan who was in exile what kind
of youth this young king was; and the Spartan made reply,
&ldquo;If you have any designs against <!-- page 278--><a
name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 278</span>Sparta, you
had better begin them before the game chicken&rsquo;s spurs are
grown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a great pity that these two free states in Laconia and
Achaia were only wasting their strength against each other,
instead of joining against Macedon.</p>

cared more for Achaia than for Greece, and soon was again at war
with Sparta, and Cleomenes marched out against him.&nbsp; He
retreated, and Cleomenes in great joy put his troops in mind how
in old times the Spartans never asked how many were the foe, but
only where they were.&nbsp; Then he followed the Achaians and
gained a great victory; indeed there was a doubt at first whether
Aratus were not slain; but he had marched off with the remnant of
the army, and next was heard of as having taken Mantinea.</p>
<p>This displeased the Ephors, and they called Cleomenes
back.&nbsp; He hoped to be stronger by the aid of his
fellow-king, and, as the little child of Agis had just died in
his house, sent to invite home Archidamas, the brother of Agis,
who was living in exile; but the Ephors had the youth murdered as
soon as he reached Laconia, and then laid on Cleomenes both this
murder and that of his little stepson Agis.&nbsp; But all the
better sort held <!-- page 280--><a name="page280"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 280</span>by him, and his mother Cratesiclea,
and his wife Agiatis, so cleared him, that all trusted him, and
he was again sent out with an army, and defeated Aratus.</p>
<p>He was sure he could bring back good days to Sparta, if only
he were free of the Ephors.&nbsp; One of these, who was on his
side, went to sleep in a temple, and there had a dream that four
of the chairs of the Ephors were taken away, and that he heard a
voice saying, &ldquo;This is best for Sparta.&rdquo;&nbsp; After
this, he and Cleomenes contrived that the king should lead out an
army containing most of the party against him.&nbsp; He took them
by long marches to a great distance from home, and then left them
at night with a few trusty friends, with whom he fell upon the
Ephors at supper, and killed four of them, the only blood he shed
in this matter.&nbsp; In the morning he called the people
together, and showed them how the Ephors had taken too much
power, and how ill they had used it, especially in the murder of
Agis; and the people agreed henceforth to let him rule without
them.&nbsp; Then all debts were given up, all estates resigned to
be divided again, Cleomenes himself being the first to set the
example, and the partition was made.&nbsp; But as one line of the
Heracleid kings was extinct, Cleomenes made his brother Euclidas
reign with him, and was able to bring back all the old ways of
Lycurgus, the hard fare and plain living, so that those who had
seen the Eastern state of the upstart Macedonian soldiers
wondered at the sight of the son of Hercules, descendant of a
line <!-- page 281--><a name="page281"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 281</span>of thirty-one kings, showing his
royalty only in the noble simplicity of his bearing.</p>
<p>Mantinea turned out the Achaians and invited Cleomenes back,
and now it was plain that the real question was whether the
Spartan kingdom or the Achaian League should lead the
Peloponnesus&mdash;in truth, between Aratus and Cleomenes.&nbsp;
Another victory was gained over the Achaians, a treaty was made,
and they were going to name Cleomenes head of the League, when he
fell ill.&nbsp; He had over-tried his strength by long marches,
and chilled himself by drinking cold water; he broke a
blood-vessel, and had to be carried home in a litter, causing
meantime the Achaian prisoners to be set free, to show that he
meant to keep the treaty.</p>
<p>But Aratus, in his jealousy, forgot that the great work of his
youth had been to get free of Macedon, and in order to put down
Sparta and Cleomenes, actually asked the help of Antigonus, king
of Macedon, and brought his hated troops back into the
Peloponnesus, promising to welcome them, if only Cleomenes might
be put down.</p>
<p>The brave young king had recovered and taken Argos, and soon
after Corinth drove out the Achaian garrison and gave themselves
to him; but the great Macedonian force under Antigonus himself
was advancing, and Corinth in terror went over to him, the other
allies deserted, and Cleomenes was marching back to Sparta, when
a messenger met him at Tegea with tidings of the death of his
beloved wife.&nbsp; He <!-- page 282--><a
name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 282</span>listened
steadily, gave orders for the defence of Tegea, and then,
travelling all night, went home and gave way to an agony of
grief, with his mother and two little children.</p>
<p>He had but 5000 Spartans, and his only hope was in getting aid
from Ptolemy the Benefactor, king of Egypt.&nbsp; This was
promised, but only on condition that he would send as hostages to
Egypt his mother and babes.&nbsp; He was exceedingly grieved, and
could not bear to tell his mother; but she saw his distress, and
found out the cause from his friends.&nbsp; She laughed in hopes
of cheering him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Was this what you feared to tell
me?&nbsp; Put me on board ship at once, and send this old carcase
where it may be of the most use to Sparta.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
escorted her, at the head of the whole army, to the promontory of
T&aelig;narus, where the temple of Neptune looks out into the
sea.&nbsp; In the temple they parted, Cleomenes weeping in such
bitter sorrow that his mother&rsquo;s spirit rose.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Go to, king of Sparta,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Without doors, let none see us weep, nor do anything
contrary to the honour and dignity of Sparta.&nbsp; That at least
is in our own power, though, for the rest, success or failure
depends on the gods.&rdquo;&nbsp; So she sailed away, and
Cleomenes went back to do his part.&nbsp; The Achaians had not
only given Antigonus the title of Head of the League, but had set
up his statues, and were giving him the divine honours that had
been granted to Alexander and to Demetrius the City-taker.</p>
<p>The only part of the Peloponnesus that still held out <!--
page 283--><a name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
283</span>was Laconia.&nbsp; Cleomenes guarded all the passes,
though the struggle was almost without hope, for little help came
from Egypt, only a letter from brave old Cratesiclea, begging
that whatever was best for the country might be done without
regard to an old woman or a child.&nbsp; Cleomenes then let the
slaves buy their freedom, and made 2000 soldiers from among them,
and marching out with these he surprised and took the Achaian
city of Megalopolis.&nbsp; One small party of citizens, under a
brave young man named Philop&oelig;men, fought, while the rest
had time to escape to Messene.&nbsp; Cleomenes offered to give
them back the place if they would join with Sparta, but they
refused, and he had the whole town plundered and burnt as a
warning to the other Peloponnesians, and the next year he ravaged
Argolis, and beat down the standing corn with great wooden
swords.</p>
<p>But Antigonus had collected a vast force to subdue the
Peloponnesus, and Cleomenes prepared for his last battle at
Sellasia, a place between two hills.&nbsp; On one named Evas he
placed his brother Euclidas, on the other named Olympus he posted
himself, with his cavalry in the middle.&nbsp; He had but 20,000
men, and Antigonus three times as many, with all the Achaians
among them.&nbsp; Euclidas did not, as his brother had intended,
charge down the hill, but was driven backwards over the
precipices that lay behind him.&nbsp; The cavalry were beaten by
Philop&oelig;men, who fought all day, though a javelin had
pierced both his legs; and <!-- page 284--><a
name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 284</span>Cleomenes
found it quite impossible to break the Macedonian phalanx, and
out of his 6000 Spartans found himself at the end of the day with
only 200.</p>
<p>With these he rode back to Sparta, where he stopped in the
market-place to tell his people that all was lost, and they had
better make what terms they could.&nbsp; They should decide
whether his life or death were best for him, and while they
deliberated, he turned towards his own empty house, but he could
not bear to enter it.&nbsp; A slave girl taken from Megalopolis
ran out to bring him food and drink, but he would taste nothing,
only being tired out he leant his arm sideways against a pillar
and laid his head on it, and so he waited in silence till word
was brought him that the citizens wished him to escape.</p>
<p>He quietly left Sparta and sailed for Alexandria, where the
king, Ptolemy the Benefactor, at first was short and cold with
him, because he would not cringe to him, but soon learned to
admire him, treated him as a brother, promised him help to regain
Sparta, and gave him a pension, which he spent in relieving other
exiled Greeks.&nbsp; But the Benefactor died, and his son,
Ptolemy Philopator, was a selfish wretch, who hated and dreaded
the grave, stern man who was a continual rebuke to him, and who,
the Alexandrians said, walked about like a lion in a
sheepfold.&nbsp; He refused the fleet his father had promised,
would not let Cleomenes go back alone to try his fortune on
Antigonus&rsquo; death, and at last, on some report of his
meaning to attack Cyrene, <!-- page 285--><a
name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 285</span>had him
shut up with his friends in a large room.&nbsp; They broke forth,
and tried to fight their way to a ship, but they were hemmed in,
no one came to their aid, and rather than be taken prisoners,
they all fell on their own swords; and on the tidings, Ptolemy
commanded all the women and children to be put to death.&nbsp;
Cratesiclea saw her two grandsons slain before her eyes, and then
crying, &ldquo;Oh, children, where are ye gone?&rdquo; herself
held out her neck for the rope.</p>

jealousy and rivalry of Aratus and the Achaians had made them put
themselves under the power of Macedon, in order thus to overthrow
Sparta.&nbsp; Aratus seemed to have lost all his skill and
spirit, for when the robber &AElig;tolians again made an attack
on the Peloponnesus, he managed so ill as to have a great defeat;
and the Achaians were forced again to call for the help of the
Macedonians, whose king was now Philip, son to Antigonus.</p>
<p>A war went on for many years between the Macedonians, with the
Achaians on the one hand and the &AElig;tolians on the
other.&nbsp; Aratus was a friend and adviser to Philip, but would
gladly have loosened the yoke he had helped to lay on
Greece.&nbsp; When the old Messenian town of Ithome fell into the
hands of Philip, he went into the temple of Jupiter, with Aratus
and another adviser called Demetrius the Pharian, to consult the
sacrifices as to whether he should put a <!-- page 287--><a
name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 287</span>garrison
into Ithome to overawe Messenia.&nbsp; The omens were doubtful,
and Philip asked his two friends what they thought.&nbsp;
Demetrius said, &ldquo;If you have the soul of a priest, you will
restore the fort to the Messenians; if you have the soul of a
prince, you will hold the ox by both his horns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ox was, of course, the Peloponnesus, and the other horn
was the Acro-Corinthus, which, with Ithome, gave Philip power
over the whole peninsula.&nbsp; The king then asked Aratus&rsquo;
advice.&nbsp; He said, &ldquo;Thieves nestle in the fastnesses of
rocks.&nbsp; A king&rsquo;s best fortress is loyalty and
love;&rdquo; and at his words Philip turned away, and left the
fort to its own people.&nbsp; He was at that time a youth full of
good promise, but he let himself be led astray by the vices and
pleasures of his court, and withdrew his favour from
Aratus.&nbsp; Then he began to misuse the Messenians, and had
their country ravaged.&nbsp; Aratus, who was for the seventeenth
time general of the League, made a complaint, and Philip, in
return, contrived that he should be slowly poisoned.&nbsp; He
said nothing; only once, when a friend noticed his illness, he
said, &ldquo;This is the effect of the friendship of
kings.&rdquo;&nbsp; He died in 213, and just about this time
Philop&oelig;men of Megalopolis returned from serving in the
Cretan army to fight for his country.&nbsp; He was a thoroughly
noble-hearted man, and a most excellent general, and he did much
to improve the Achaian army.&nbsp; In the meantime Sparta had
fallen under the power of another tyrant, called Nabis, a
horribly cruel <!-- page 288--><a name="page288"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 288</span>wretch, who had had a statue made in
the likeness of his wife, with nails and daggers all over her
breast.&nbsp; His enemies were put into her arms; she clasped
them, and thus they died.&nbsp; He robbed the unhappy people of
Sparta; and all the thieves, murderers, and outlaws of the
country round were taken into his service, and parties of them
sent out to collect plunder all over the Peloponnesus.&nbsp; At
last one of his grooms ran away with some horses, and took refuge
at Megalopolis, and this Nabis made a cause for attacking both
that city and Messenia; but at last Philop&oelig;men was made
general of the Achaian League, and gave the wretch such a defeat
as forced him to keep at home, while Philop&oelig;men ravaged
Laconia.</p>
<p>Philip of Macedon offered to come and drive out Nabis if the
Achaians would help him, but they distrusted him, and did not
choose to go to war with the Romans, whom the robber
&AElig;tolians had called from Italy to assist them.&nbsp;
However, Philip reduced Nabis to make all sorts of promises and
treaties, which, of course, he did not keep, but invited in the
&AElig;tolians to assist him.&nbsp; This, however, brought his
punishment on him, for soon after their arrival these allies of
his murdered him, and began to rob all Laconia.&nbsp;
Philop&oelig;men and his Achaians at once marched into the
country, helped the Spartans to deliver themselves from the
robbers, and persuaded them to join the League.&nbsp; They were
so much pleased with him that they resolved to give him
Nabis&rsquo; palace and treasure, <!-- page 289--><a
name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 289</span>but he was
known to hate bribes so much that nobody could at first be found
to make him the offer.&nbsp; One man was sent to Megalopolis, but
when he saw Philop&oelig;men&rsquo;s plain, grave, hardy life,
and heard how much he disapproved of sloth and luxury, he did not
venture to say a word about the palace full of Eastern
magnificence, but went back to Sparta.&nbsp; He was sent again,
and still found no opportunity; and when, the third time, he did
speak, Philop&oelig;men thanked the Spartans, but said he advised
them not to spend their riches on spoiling honest men, whose help
they might have at no cost at all, but rather to use them in
buying over those who made mischief among them.</p>
<p>Wars were going on at this time between Philip of Macedon, on
the one side, and the &AElig;tolians on the other.&nbsp;
Philip&rsquo;s ally was Antiochus the Great, the Greek king of
Syria; the &AElig;tolians had called in the Romans, that great,
conquering Italian nation, whose plan was always to take the part
of some small nation against a more powerful one, break the
strength of both, and then join them to their own empire.&nbsp;
But the Achaians did not know this, and wished them well, while
they defeated the Macedonians at the great battle of
Cynocephal&aelig;, or the Dog&rsquo;s Head Rocks, in
Thessaly.&nbsp; Philip was obliged to make peace, and one
condition required of him was that he should give up all claims
to power over Greece.&nbsp; Then at Corinth, at the Isthmian
games, the Roman consul, Quintius Flaminius, proclaimed that the
Greek states were once more free.&nbsp; <!-- page 290--><a
name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 290</span>Such a
shout of joy was raised that it is said that birds flying in the
air overhead dropped down with the shock, and Flaminius was
almost stifled by the crowds of grateful Greeks who came round
him to cover him with garlands and kiss his hands.</p>

</a></p>
<p>But, after all, the Romans meant to keep a hold on Greece,
though they left the cities to themselves for a little
while.&nbsp; The Spartans who had been banished by Nabis had not
returned home, but lived a life of robbery, which was thought to
be favoured by Philop&oelig;men, and this offended those at home,
some of <!-- page 291--><a name="page291"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 291</span>whom plundered a town called
Las.&nbsp; The Achaians demanded that the guilty should be given
up to them for punishment, and a war began, which ended by a
savage attack on Sparta, in which Philop&oelig;men forgot all but
the old enmity between Achaia and Laconia, put ninety citizens to
death, pulled down the walls, besides abolishing the laws of
Lycurgus, which, however, nobody had observed since the fall of
Cleomenes.&nbsp; Many citizens were sent into banishment, and
these went to Rome to complain of the Achaians.&nbsp; While they
were gone the Messenians rose against the League, while
Philop&oelig;men was lying sick of a fever at Argos; but though
he was ill, and seventy years old, he collected a small troop of
young Megalopolitan horsemen, to join the main army with
them.&nbsp; But he met the full force of the Messenians, and
while fighting bravely to shelter his young followers, received a
blow on the head which stunned him, so that he was made prisoner,
and carried to Messene.&nbsp; There his enemies showed him in the
theatre, but the people only recollected how noble he was, and
how he had defended all Greece from Nabis.&nbsp; So his enemies
hurried him away, and put him in an underground dungeon, where,
at night, they sent an executioner to carry him a dose of
poison.&nbsp; Philop&oelig;men raised himself with difficulty,
for he was very weak, and asked the man whether he could tell him
what had become of his young Megalopolitan friends.&nbsp; The man
replied that he thought they had most of them escaped.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You <!-- page 292--><a name="page292"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 292</span>bring good news,&rdquo; said
Philop&oelig;men; then, swallowing the draught, he laid himself
on his back, and, almost instantly died.&nbsp; He is called the
Last of the Greeks, for there never was a great man of the old
sort after him.</p>

<img class='dc' alt='A' title='A' src='images/dca.jpg' />fter the
death of Philop&oelig;men there was little real spirit left in
the Achaians, and Callicrates, who became the leading man among
them, led them to submit themselves to the senate of Rome, and do
as it pleased with regard to Sparta and Messene.</p>
<p>Philip of Macedon was at war with Rome all his life, and his
son Perseus went on with it.&nbsp; Marcus Paullus &AElig;milius,
one of the best and bravest of the Romans, was sent to subdue
him, and the great battle was fought in 188, at Pydna, near Mount
Olympus.&nbsp; The night before the battle there was an eclipse
of the moon, which greatly terrified the Macedonians; but the
Romans had among them an officer who knew enough of the movements
of the heavenly bodies to have told the soldiers of it
beforehand, and its cause.&nbsp; The Macedonians being thus
discouraged, gave way, and fled as soon as the battle seemed to
be going against them; and Perseus himself galloped from the
field to Pella, where he was so beside himself with <!-- page
294--><a name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
294</span>despair that he stabbed two of his counsellors who
tried to show him the mistakes he had made.&nbsp; But as
&AElig;milius advanced, he was forced to retreat before him, even
into the island of Samothrace, which was sacred soil, whence he
could not be taken by force.&nbsp; The Romans watched all round
the island, and he dreaded that the Samothracians should give him
up to them; so he bargained with a Cretan shipmaster to take him
and all his treasure on board his ship, and carry him off at
night.&nbsp; The Cretan received half the treasure, and Perseus
crept out at a small window, crossed a garden, and reached the
wharf, where, to his horror, he found that the treacherous
captain had sailed off with the treasure, and left him
behind.</p>
<p>There was nothing for him to do but to yield to the
Romans.&nbsp; He came into the camp in mourning, and
&AElig;milius gave him his hand and received him kindly, but kept
him a prisoner, and formed Macedon into a province under Roman
government.&nbsp; &AElig;milius himself went on a journey through
the most famous Greek cities, especially admiring Athens, and
looking at the places made famous by historians, poets, and
philosophers.&nbsp; He took Polybius, a learned Athenian
philosopher, who wrote the history of this war, to act as tutor
to his two sons, though both were young men able to fight in this
campaign, and from that time forward the Romans were glad to have
Greek teachers for their sons, and Greek was spoken by them as
freely and easily as their own Latin; every well-educated man
<!-- page 295--><a name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

school of philosophy, either Stoic or Epicurean, but the best men
were generally Stoics.</p>

</a>Perseus and his two young sons were taken to Rome, there,
according to the Roman fashion, to march in the triumph of the
conqueror, namely, the procession in which the general returned
home with all his troops.&nbsp; It was a shame much feared by the
conquered princes, and the cruel old rule was that they should be
put to death at the close of the march.&nbsp; Paullus
&AElig;milius was, however, a man of kind temper, and had
promised Perseus to spare his life.&nbsp; The unfortunate king
begged to be spared the humiliation of walking in the triumph,
but &AElig;milius could not disappoint the Roman people, and
answered that &ldquo;the favour was in Perseus&rsquo; own
power,&rdquo; meaning, since he knew no better, that to die
should prevent what was so much dreaded.&nbsp; Perseus, however,
did not take the counsel, but lived in an Italian city for the
rest of his life.</p>
<p><!-- page 296--><a name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
296</span>After Macedon was ruined the Romans resolved to put
down all stirrings of resistance to them in the rest of
Greece.&nbsp; Their friend Callicrates, therefore, accused all
the Achaians who had been friendly to Perseus, or who had any
brave spirit&mdash;1000 in number&mdash;of conspiring against
Rome, and called on the League to sentence them to death; but as
this proposal was heard with horror, they were sent to Rome to
justify themselves, and the Roman senate, choosing to suppose
they had been judged by the League, sentenced them never to
return to Achaia.&nbsp; Polybius was among them, so that his home
was thenceforth in the house of his pupils, the sons of
&AElig;milius.&nbsp; Many times did the Achaians send entreaties
that they might be set at liberty, and at last, after seventeen
years, Polybius&rsquo; pupils persuaded the great senator Cato to
speak for them, and he did so, but in a very rough, unfeeling
way.&nbsp; &ldquo;Anyone who saw us disputing whether a set of
poor old Greeks should be buried by our grave-diggers or their
own would think we had nothing else to do,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
So the Romans consented to their going home; but when they asked
to have all their rank and honours restored to them, Cato said,
&ldquo;Polybius, you are less wise than Ulysses.&nbsp; You want
to go back into the Cyclops&rsquo; cave for the wretched rags and
tatters you left behind you there.&rdquo;&nbsp; After all,
Polybius either did not go home or did not stay there, for he was
soon again with his beloved pupils; and in the seventeen years of
exile the 1000 had so melted away that only 300 went home
again.</p>

made by the Macedonians, under a pretender who claimed to be the
son of Perseus, and by the Peloponnesians, with the Achaians and
Spartans at their head, while the Corinthians insulted the Roman
ambassadors.&nbsp; A Roman general named Quintus Metellus was
sent to subdue them, and routed the Macedonians at the battle of
Scarph&aelig;a, but after that another general named Mummius was
sent out.&nbsp; The Achaians had collected all their strength
against him, and in the first skirmish gained a little success;
and this encouraged them to risk a battle, in which they were so
confident <!-- page 298--><a name="page298"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 298</span>of victory that they placed their
wives and children on a hill to watch them, and provided waggons
to carry away the spoil.&nbsp; The battle was fought at
Leucoptera, near the Isthmus, and all this boasting was soon
turned into a miserable defeat.&nbsp; Di&aelig;us, who commanded
the Greeks, was put to flight, and riding off to Megalopolis in
utter despair, he killed his wife and children, to prevent their
falling into the hands of the enemy, and then poisoned
himself.</p>
<p>The other Achaians at first retreated into Corinth, and in the
course of the night scattered themselves each to his own
city.&nbsp; In the morning Mummius marched in and gave up the
unhappy city to plunder.&nbsp; All the men were slain, all the
women and children taken for slaves, and when all the statues,
pictures, and jewels had been gathered out of the temples and
houses, the place was set on fire, and burnt unceasingly for
several days; the walls were pulled down, and the city blotted
out from Greece.&nbsp; There was so much metal of all kinds in
the burning houses that it all became fused together, and
produced a new and valuable metal called Corinthian brass.&nbsp;
The Romans were at this time still very rude and ignorant, and
did not at all understand the value and beauty of the works of
art they carried off.&nbsp; Polybius saw two soldiers making a
dice-board of one of the most famous pictures in Greece; and
Mummius was much laughed at for telling the captains of the ships
who took home some of the statues to exhibit in his triumph that
if they lost them they should supply <!-- page 299--><a
name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 299</span>new ones at
their own cost.&nbsp; The Corinthians suffered thus for having
insulted the ambassadors.&nbsp; The other cities submitted
without a blow, and were left untouched to govern themselves, but
in subjection to Rome, and with Roman garrisons in their
citadels.&nbsp; Polybius was sent round them to assure them of
peace, and they had it for more than 500 years, but the freedom
of Greece was gone for ever.</p>

time Macedon and Achaia were made by the Romans into provinces,
each of which had a governor who had been one year in a
magistrate&rsquo;s office at Rome, and then was sent out to rule
in a province for three or for five years.</p>
<p>In 146, nearly a hundred years after the ruin of Corinth,
Julius C&aelig;sar built it up again in great strength and
beauty, and made it the capital of Achaia.&nbsp; As it stood
where the Isthmus was only six miles across, and had a beautiful
harbour on each side, travellers who did not wish to go round the
dangerous headlands of the Peloponnesus used to land on one side
and embark on the other.&nbsp; Thus Corinth become one of the
great stations for troops, and also a mart for all kinds of
merchandise, and was always full of strangers, both Greeks and
Jews.</p>
<p>The Romans, as conquerors, had rights to be tried only by
their own magistrates and laws, and these laws were generally
just.&nbsp; They were, however, very hard <!-- page 301--><a

<p>Athens had never had a great statesman or soldier in her since
the time of Phocion, but her philosophers and orators still went
on discoursing in the schools, and for four hundred years at
least Athens was a sort of university town, where the rich young
men from Rome, Carthage, Alexandria, Asia Minor, and Syria came
to see the grand old buildings and works of art, and to finish
their education.&nbsp; For though the great men of Greece were
all dead, their works, both in stone and in writing, still
remained, and were the models of all the world, and their
language was spoken all over the East.&nbsp; <!-- page 302--><a
name="page302"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 302</span>The
Romans&rsquo; own tongue, Latin, was used at home, of course, but
every gentleman knew Greek equally well, and all the Syrians,
Jews, and Egyptians who had much intercourse with them used Greek
as the language sure to be known&mdash;much as French is now used
all over Europe.</p>
<p>But there was an answer coming to all those strainings and
yearnings after God and His truth which had made those old Greek
writings beautiful.&nbsp; There is a story that one night a
ship&rsquo;s crew, passing near a lonely island in the
&AElig;gean Sea, sacred to the gods, heard a great wailing and
crying aloud of spirit voices, exclaiming, &ldquo;Great Pan is
dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pan was the heathen god of nature, to whom sacred places were
dedicated, and this strange crying was at the very night after a
day when, far away in Jud&aelig;a, the sun had been darkened at
noon, and the rocks were rent, and One who was dying on a cross
had said, &ldquo;It is finished.&rdquo;&nbsp; For the victory
over Satan and all his spirits was won by death.</p>
<p>Some fifteen years later than that day, as Paul, a Jew of
Tarsus, in Asia Minor, with the right of Roman citizenship, and a
Greek education, was spreading the knowledge of that victory over
the East&mdash;while he slept at the new Troy built by Alexander,
there stood by his bed, in a vision by night, a man of Macedon,
saying, &ldquo;Come over and help us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went, knowing that the call came from God, and the cities
of Macedon gained quite new honours.&nbsp; <!-- page 303--><a
name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 303</span>Philippi,
where he was first received, had a small number of Jews in it, to
whom he spake by the river side, but many Greeks soon began to
listen; and then it was that the evil spirits, who spake aloud to
men in heathen lands, first had to own the power of Christ, who
had conquered.&nbsp; A slave girl, who had long been possessed by
one of these demons, was forced at the sight of Paul and his
companion Silas to cry aloud, &ldquo;These men are the servants
of the Most High God, which show unto us the way of
salvation.&rdquo;&nbsp; She followed them about for some days
doing this, until Paul, grieved in the spirit, bade the evil one,
in <span class="smcap">Jesus&rsquo;</span> name, to leave
her.&nbsp; At once the name of the Conqueror caused the demon to
depart; but the owner of the slave girl, enraged at the loss of
her soothsaying powers, accused the Apostle and his friend to the
magistrates, and, without examination, they were thrown into
prison.&nbsp; At night, while they sang praise in the dungeon, an
earthquake shook it; the doors were open, the fetters loosed, and
the jailer, thinking them fled, would have killed himself, but
for Paul&rsquo;s call to him that all were safe.&nbsp; He heard
the Word of life that night, and was baptised; but St. Paul would
not leave the prison, either then or at the permission of the
magistrates, when they found they had exceeded their powers, but
insisted that they should come themselves to fetch him out, thus
marking his liberty as a Roman, so that others might fear to
touch him.&nbsp; He had founded a church at Philippi, in which he
always found great comfort and <!-- page 304--><a
name="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 304</span>joy; and
when he was forced to go on to Thessalonica, he found many
willing and eager hearers among the Greeks; but the Jews, enraged
at his teaching these, stirred up the mob, and not only forced
him to leave that city, but hunted him wherever he tried to stop
in Macedon, so that he was obliged to hurry into the next
province, Achaia, and wait at Athens for the companions whom he
had left to go on with his work at Philippi and Thessalonica.</p>

</a></p>
<p>While at Athens, the multitude of altars and temples, and the
devotion paid to them, stirred his spirit, so that he could not
but speak out plainly, and point to the <!-- page 305--><a
name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
305</span>truth.&nbsp; It seemed a new philosophy to the talkers
and inquirers, who had talked to shreds the old arguments of
Plato and Epicurus, and longed for some fresh light or new
interest; and he was invited to Areopagus to set forth his
doctrine.&nbsp; There, in the face of the Parthenon and the
Acropolis, with philosophers and students from all parts of the
empire around, he made one of his greatest and noblest
speeches&mdash;&ldquo;Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all
things ye are greatly religious.&nbsp; For as I passed through
your city, and beheld how ye worship, I found an altar with this
inscription&mdash;&lsquo;<span class="smcap">To the unknown
God</span>.&rsquo;&nbsp; Whom, therefore, ye ignorantly worship;
Him declare I unto you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, looking forth on the temples crowded on the rocks, he
tried to open their minds to the truth that the God of all dwells
in no temples made with hands, that all men alike are His
children, and that, since living, breathing, thinking man has
sprung from Him, it is lowering His greatness to represent Him by
cold, dead, senseless stone, metal, or ivory.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
bore with the times of ignorance,&rdquo; said Paul; &ldquo;but
now He called on all men to turn to Him to prepare for the day
when all should be judged, by the Man whom He had ordained for
the purpose, as had been shown by His rising from the
dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Greeks had listened to the proclamation of one great
unseen God, higher than art could represent; but when Paul spoke
of rising from the dead, they burst into mockery.&nbsp; They had
believed in spirits living, but <!-- page 306--><a
name="page306"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 306</span>not in
bodies rising again, and the philosophers would not listen.&nbsp;
Very few converts were made in Athens, only Dionysius, and a
woman named Damaris, and a few more; and the city of learning
long closed her ears against those who would have taught her what
Socrates and Plato had been feeling after like men in the
dark.</p>
<p>At the merchant city of Corinth, Paul had greater success; he
stayed there nearly two years, and from thence sent letters to
the Thessalonians, who were neglecting their daily duties,
expecting that our Lord was about immediately to return.&nbsp;
After Paul had left Corinth, he wrote to that city also, first to
correct certain evils that had arisen in the Church there, and
afterwards to encourage those who had repented, and promise
another visit.&nbsp; This visit, as well as one to his Macedonian
churches, was paid in his third journey; and when he had been
arrested at Jerusalem, and was in Rome awaiting his trial before
the emperor, Nero, he wrote to his friends at Philippi what is
called the Epistle of Joy, so bright were his hopes of his
friends there.</p>
<p>St. Andrew also laboured in Greece, and was put to death in
Achaia, by being fastened to a cross of olive-wood, shaped like
an X, where he hung exhorting the people for three days before he
died.&nbsp; When St. Paul was released, he and the great
evangelist St. John, and such of the apostles as still survived,
set the Church in order, appointing bishops over their cities,
and Dionysius of Athens became Bishop of Corinth, and St.
Paul&rsquo;s <!-- page 307--><a name="page307"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 307</span>pupil from Antioch, Titus, was
Bishop of Crete, and received an epistle from Paul on the duties
of his office.&nbsp; In process of time Christianity won its way,
and the oracles became silent, as the demons which spoke in them
fled from the Name of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>.</p>

<img class='dc' alt='F' title='F' src='images/dcf.jpg' />or three
hundred years Rome reigned over all the countries round the
Mediterranean, with one emperor at her head, and the magistrates
of his appointment to rule in all the provinces, while garrisons
were placed to quell risings of the people, or to keep in order
the wild tribes on any dangerous border.&nbsp; For a long course
of years Greece was quiet, and had no need of such troops.&nbsp;
The people of her cities were allowed to manage their own affairs
enough to satisfy them and make them contented, though they had
lost all but such freedom as they could have by being enrolled as
citizens of Rome, and they were too near the heart of the empire
to be in danger from barbarous neighbours, so that they did not
often have troops among them, except those passing through
Corinth to the East.</p>
<p>Towards the end of these three hundred years, however, Thrace
and Thessaly began to be threatened by wild nations who came from
the banks of the Danube, and robbed the rich villages and
countries to the south.&nbsp; The empire was, in truth, growing
weaker, and enemies <!-- page 309--><a name="page309"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 309</span>began to press upon it; and this
made the emperor, Diocletian, decide that it was beyond the power
of any one man to rule and defend it all, and he therefore
divided it with his friend Maximian, whom he made Emperor of the
East, while he remained Emperor of the West.&nbsp; The Western
empire was the Latin-speaking half, and the Eastern the
Greek-speaking half, of these lands, though both still called
themselves Roman.</p>

<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>The two halves were joined together again, about the <!-- page
310--><a name="page310"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
310</span>year 300, under Constantine the Great, who was the
first Christian emperor.&nbsp; He thought he should be more in
the middle of his government if he moved his capital from Rome to
the old Greek city of Byzantium, which he adorned with most
splendid buildings, and called after his own name,
Constantinople; and this became the capital of the East, as Rome
was of the West.&nbsp; Athens remained all this time the place of
study for Christians as well as heathens, and people still talked
philosophy and studied eloquence among the laurel and myrtle
groves, and looked at the temples, which still stood there,
though hardly anyone frequented them.&nbsp; One emperor, Julian,
the cousin of Constantine, studied there as a youth, and became
so fond of the old philosophy and learning, and so admired the
noble ways of the times when men were seeking after truth, that
he thought Greece and Rome would be great again if they turned
back to these heathen ways, not seeing that this was going back
to the dark out of which those men had been struggling.</p>
<p>Julian tried to bring back heathen customs, and to have the
old gods worshipped again; but he was killed in an expedition
against the Persians, and soon after his time the old
idol-worship was quite forgotten.&nbsp; Every city had a Bishop
and clergy, and the Bishops of each division of the empire were
under a great ruling Bishop, who was called a Patriarch.&nbsp;
Greece was under the Patriarch of Constantinople.&nbsp; The Greek
churches were made as like the pattern of the temple at Jerusalem
<!-- page 311--><a name="page311"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
311</span>as they could be.&nbsp; The end which represented the
Holy of Holies, and had the altar in it, was veiled, and enclosed
within what were called the Royal Gates, and these were only
opened at times of celebrating the Holy Communion.&nbsp; This end
was raised steps, and the Holy Scriptures and sermon were spoken
to the people from the front of the Royal Gates.&nbsp; The
pavement was of rich marble, and the ceiling, which was generally
vaulted, was inlaid with coloured stones, making pictures in what
is called Mosaic, because thus the stones were set by Moses in
the High Priest&rsquo;s vestment.&nbsp; The clergy wore robes
like those of the priests, and generally had flowing hair and
beards, though in front the hair was cut in a circlet, in memory
of our Lord&rsquo;s crown of thorns.</p>
<p>Now that everyone had become Christian, and bad or worldly
people were not afraid to belong to the Church for fear of
persecution, there was often sin and evil among them.&nbsp; Many
who grieved at this shut themselves up from the world in the most
lonely places they could find&mdash;little islands, deep woods,
mountain tops, or rocks, and the like.&nbsp; When they lived
alone they were called hermits, when there were many together
they were called monks, and the women who thus lived were
nuns.&nbsp; Many such monasteries there were in Greece,
especially one upon Mount Athos&mdash;that peninsula that Xerxes
tried to cut off&mdash;and most of these have continued even to
our own time.</p>
<p>The emperor Theodosius, who reigned at the end of <!-- page
312--><a name="page312"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
312</span>this fourth century over both East and West, was a very
good and great man, and during his reign the Greek lands were
kept from the marauders.&nbsp; In his time, however, the
Thessalonians brought a most dreadful punishment on
themselves.&nbsp; For want of public business, or any real and
noble interest, the people had come to care for nothing but games
and races, and they loved these sports with a sort of passionate
fury.&nbsp; There was a chariot-driver at Thessalonica who was a
wicked man, but whose racing was so much admired that when, for
some crime, Botheric, the governor, put him in prison and
hindered his performance, the mob rose, when they missed him in
the amphitheatre, and threw stones at the governor and his
officers, so that several were killed, and Botheric among
them.&nbsp; The news was taken to the emperor, and in great wrath
he ordered that the Thessalonians should be punished.&nbsp; The
order was given to a cruel, savage man, who hurried off at once,
lest the emperor should relent and stop him.&nbsp; He invited the
Thessalonians to meet him in the amphitheatre, and when they were
there, expecting to hear some message, he had all the doors
closed, and sent in his soldiers, who killed them all, innocent
as well as guilty, even strangers who had only just come to the
place.</p>
<p>Theodosius was much shocked to find how his passionate words
had been obeyed, and the good Bishop of Milan, St. Ambrose, made
him wait as a penitent, cut off from the Holy Communion, while he
was thus <!-- page 313--><a name="page313"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 313</span>stained with blood, until after many
months his repentance could be accepted, and he could be
forgiven.</p>

<img class="floatright" alt=

</a>After Theodosius died, the Western half of the empire was
overrun and conquered by tribes of German nations, but the
Eastern part still remained, and emperor after emperor reigned at
Constantinople, ruling over the Greek cities as before; but there
were savage tribes of the Slavonian race who settled in Thrace,
and spread over Thessaly.&nbsp; They were called Bulgarians, and
used to send marauders all over the country to the south, so that
they were much dreaded by the Greeks, who had long forgotten how
to fight for themselves.</p>
<p>But though the Eastern and Western empires were broken apart,
the Church was one.&nbsp; The Greeks, indeed, found fault with
the Romans for putting three words into the Creed of Nicea which
had not been <!-- page 314--><a name="page314"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 314</span>decided on by the consent of the
whole Church in Council, and there was a question between the
Pope of Rome and the Patriarch of Constantinople as to which had
the chief rule.&nbsp; At last their disputes in the eleventh
century caused a schism, or ruling apart, and the Greek Church
became separated from the Roman Church.</p>

<p>
<img class='dc' alt='T' title='T' src='images/dct.jpg' />here is
very little to tell about Greece for hundreds of years.&nbsp; It
was a part of the Eastern Empire, and was for the most part in a
quiet state, except when robbers came against it.&nbsp; The
Bulgarians came from the North, but after they had become
Christian they were somewhat less dangerous.&nbsp; From the East
and South came Saracens and Moors, who had been converted to the
faith of the false Arabian prophet Mahommed; and from the West
came the Northmen, all the way from Norway and Denmark, to rob
the very east end of the Mediterranean, so that beautiful old
ornaments, evidently made in Greece, have been found in the
northern homes that once belonged to these sea-kings.</p>
<p>The Greeks had little spirit to fight, and the emperors took
some of these stout Northmen into their pay against the
Bulgarians and Saracens, calling them their Varangian
Guard.&nbsp; Another band, of northern blood, though they had
been settled in Normandy for two <!-- page 316--><a
name="page316"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
316</span>generations, came, and after driving out the Saracens
from Sicily and Southern Italy, set up two little kingdoms
there.&nbsp; Robert Guiscard, or the Wizard, the first and
cleverest of these Norman kings, had a great wish to gain Greece
also, and had many fights with the troops of the Emperor of the
East, Alexis Comnenus.&nbsp; Their quarrels with him made the
Greeks angry and terrified when all the bravest men of the West
wanted to come through their lands on the Crusade, or Holy War,
to deliver Jerusalem from the Saracens.&nbsp; Then, since the
schism between the Churches, the Greeks and the Latins had learnt
scarcely to think of one another as Christians at all, and
certainly they did not behave to one another like Christians, for
the Greeks cunningly robbed, harassed, and deceived the Latins,
and the Latins were harsh, rude, and violent with the Greeks.</p>
<p>In the northern point of the Adriatic Sea lay the city of
Venice, built upon a cluster of little islands.&nbsp; The people
had taken refuge there when Italy was overrun by the
barbarians.&nbsp; In course of time these Venetians had grown to
be a mighty and powerful people, whose merchant ships traded all
over the Mediterranean, and whose counsellors were famed for
wisdom.&nbsp; They had shaken off the power of the Greek emperor,
and were governed by a senate and council, with a chosen nobleman
at its head, who was called the Doge, or Duke.&nbsp; Just when
the French, Germans, and Italians were setting off on the Fourth
Crusade, in the year 1201, meaning to sail in Venetian ships,
<!-- page 317--><a name="page317"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
317</span>the young Alexius Angelus, son to the emperor Isaac
Angelus, came to beg for help for his poor old father, who had
been thrown into prison by his own brother, with his eyes put
out.&nbsp; It was quite aside from the main work of the Crusade,
but the Venetians had always had a quarrel with the Greek
emperors, and they prevailed to turn the army aside to attack
Constantinople.&nbsp; With an immense pair of shears they cut in
twain the great chains which shut in the harbour of the Golden
Horn, and sailed safely in, led by their Doge, Dandolo, who,
though eighty years old, and blind, was as keen on the battle as
the youngest man there.</p>
<p>The French scaled the walls, the usurper fled, and blind old
Isaac was led out of his dungeon, and dressed in his robes again;
his son was crowned to reign with him, and they did everything to
please the Crusaders.&nbsp; Chiefly they made the Patriarch of
Constantinople consent to give up all the differences with the
Roman Catholic Church, and own the Pope as superior to him.&nbsp;
This made the Greeks angry, and they could not bear to see their
young emperor so familiar with the French knights, whom they
looked on as barbarians.&nbsp; One day he was seen with a
Frenchman&rsquo;s cap on his head, and his own crown lying on the
ground at his feet.&nbsp; In great anger the people of
Constantinople rose, under a man named Alexius Ducas, called
&ldquo;Black-brows,&rdquo; murdered the two emperors, and set up
this new one; but he did not reign long, for the French and
Venetians <!-- page 318--><a name="page318"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 318</span>were close at hand.&nbsp; There was
a second siege, and when the city was taken they plundered it
throughout, stripped it of all the wealth they could collect, and
set up Baldwin, Count of Flanders, to be emperor, with a Latin
Patriarch; while the Venetians helped themselves to all the
southern part of the empire, namely, the Peloponnesus and the
Greek islands; and a French nobleman named Walter de Brienne was
created Duke of Athens, under the Flemish emperor.</p>

<p>It was then that so many of the old Greek places <!-- page
319--><a name="page319"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
319</span>took the names we now see them called by in the map,
and which were mostly given by the Venetian seamen.&nbsp; They
called the Peloponnesus the Morea, or Mulberry-leaf, because it
was in that shape; they called the island of Eub&oelig;a,
Negropont, or Black-bridge; the &AElig;gean Sea, the Archipelago,
or Great Sea; and the Euxine, the Black Sea, because it is so
dangerous.&nbsp; The Greeks hated their new masters very much,
and would not conform to the Roman Catholic Church.&nbsp; A new
Greek empire was set up in Asia Minor, at Nicea; and after the
Latin emperor Baldwin had been lost in a battle with the
Bulgarians, and great troubles swept away his successors, the
emperors returned to Constantinople, under Michael
Pal&aelig;ologus, in 1261, and drove out all the Franks, as the
Greeks called the Western people, chiefly French and Italians,
who had come to settle in their cities.</p>
<p>But the Venetians still held the cities in the greater part of
the Morea, and some of the islands, and traded all over the East
and West, though their Greek subjects were only kept under by
main force, still held to their own Greek Church, and looked to
the Roman Emperor of the East, as they called the
Pal&aelig;ologus at Constantinople, as their head; nor was it
easy to overpower people who had so many mountain fastnesses, nor
to tame monks whose convents were nests on the top of rocks, some
so steep that there was no way of entering them save being drawn
up in a basket.&nbsp; Well was it for them that they had niched
themselves into such <!-- page 320--><a name="page320"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 320</span>strongholds, for worse and worse
days were coming upon Greece.&nbsp; The terrible nation of Turks
were making their way out of the wild country north of Persia,
and winning the old cities of Asia Minor, where they set up their
Mahommedan dominion, and threatened more and more to overthrow
the Greek empire altogether.</p>
<p>The emperor, John Pal&aelig;ologus, was obliged to yield to
Amurath, the Turkish Sultan, all his lands except Constantinople,
Thessalonica, and that part of the Morea which still clung to the
empire, and the Turks set up their capital at Adrianople, whence
they spread their conquests up to the very walls of
Constantinople; but the Greek mountaineers, especially those of
the mountain land of Epirus, now called Albania, had something of
the old spirit among them, and fought hard.&nbsp; The Venetians
used to take troops of them into their pay, since all Christians
made common cause against the Turks; and these soldiers, richly
armed, with white Albanian kilts, the remnant of the old Greek
tunic, were called Stradiots, from the old Greek word for a
soldier, Stratiotes.&nbsp; The bravest of them all was George
Castriotes, a young Albanian, who had been given as a hostage to
the Mahommedans when nine years old.&nbsp; He had been kept a
prisoner, and made to fight in the Turkish army, and was so brave
there that the Turks called him Skanderbeg, or the Lord
Alexander.&nbsp; However, when he thought of the horror of being
a Mahommedan, and fighting against the Christian faith <!-- page
321--><a name="page321"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
321</span>and his own country, he fled into Albania, raised all
the Greeks, killed all the Turks in the country, and kept it safe
from all the further attempts of the Sultan as long as he lived,
although, at Varna, a great crusade of all the most adventurous
spirits in Europe, to drive back the Turks, was wofully defeated
in the year 1446.</p>

Emperor of the East was the best and bravest who had reigned for
many years.&nbsp; Constantine Pal&aelig;ologus did his best
against the Turks, but Mahommed II., one of the greatest of the
Ottoman race, was Sultan, and vowed that Constantinople should be
either his throne or his tomb.</p>
<p>When the besieged Christians heard the Turks outside their
walls chanting their prayers, they knew that the city would be
assaulted the next day, and late at night Constantine called his
friends together, and said, &ldquo;Though my heart is full, I can
speak to you no longer.&nbsp; There is the crown which I hold
from God.&nbsp; I place it in your hands; I entrust it to
you.&nbsp; I fight to deserve it still, or to die in defending
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; They wept and wailed so that he had to wait to
be heard again, and then he said, &ldquo;Comrades, this is our
fairest day;&rdquo; after which they all went to the Cathedral of
St. Sophia, and received the Holy Communion together.&nbsp; There
was a crowd around as he came out, and he stood before <!-- page
323--><a name="page323"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
323</span>them, begging them to pardon him for not having been
able to make them happier.&nbsp; They answered with sobs and
tears, and then he mounted his horse and rode round the
defences.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>The Turks began the attack in the early morning, and the fight
raged all day; but they were the most numerous, and kept
thronging into the breach, so that, though Constantine fought
like a lion at bay, he could not save the place, and the last
time his voice was heard it was crying out, &ldquo;Is there no
Christian who will cut <!-- page 324--><a
name="page324"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 324</span>off my
head?&rdquo;&nbsp; The Turks pressed in on all sides, cut down
the Christians, won street after street, house after house; and
when at last Mahommed rode up to the palace where Roman emperors
had reigned for 1100 years, he was so much struck with the
desolation that he repeated a verse of Persian poetry&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The spider hath woven her web in the palace
of kings,<br />
The owl hath sung her watch-song in the towers of
Afrasiab.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Search was made for the body of Constantine, and it was found
under a heap of slain, sword in hand, and so much disfigured that
it was only known by the golden eagles worked on his
buskins.&nbsp; The whole city fell under the Turks, and the
nobles and princes in the mountains of the Morea likewise owned
Mahommed as their sovereign.&nbsp; Only Albania held out as long
as the brave Skanderbeg lived to guard it; but at last, in 1466,
he fell ill of a fever, and finding that he should not live, he
called his friends and took leave of them, talking over the toils
they had shared.&nbsp; In the midst there was an alarm that the
Turks were making an inroad, and the smoke of the burning
villages could be seen.&nbsp; George called for his armour, and
tried to rise, but he was too weak, so he bade his friends hasten
to the defence, saying he should soon be able to follow.&nbsp;
When the Turks saw his banner, they thought he must be there, and
fled, losing many men in the narrow mountain roads; but the
Greeks had only just brought back the news of their success, when
their great leader died.&nbsp; His horse loved him so much that
it would <!-- page 325--><a name="page325"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 325</span>not allow itself to be touched by
any other person, became wild and fierce, and died in a few
weeks&rsquo; time.&nbsp; The Albanians could not hold out long
without their gallant chief; and when the Turks took Alyssio, the
body of Castriotes was taken from its grave, and the bones were
divided among his enemies, who wore them as charms in cases of
gold and silver, fancying they would thus gain a share of his
bravery.</p>
<p>The Turkish empire thus included all Greece on the mainland,
but the Greeks were never really subdued.&nbsp; On all the steep
hills were castles or convents, which the Turks were unable to
take; and though there were Turkish Beys and Pashas, with
soldiers placed in the towns to overawe the people, and squeeze
out a tribute, and a great deal more besides, from the Greek
tradesmen and farmers, the main body of the people still
remembered they were Greeks and Christians.&nbsp; Each village
had its own church and priest, each diocese its bishop, all
subject to the Patriarchs of Constantinople; and the Sultans,
knowing what power these had over the minds of the people, kept
them always closely watched, often imprisoned them, and sometimes
put them to death.&nbsp; The islands for the most part were still
under Venice, and some of the braver-spirited young men became
Stradiots in the Venetian service; but too many only went off
into the mountains, and became robbers and outlaws there, while
those who lived a peaceable life gave way under their miseries to
the two greatest faults there had always been <!-- page 326--><a
name="page326"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 326</span>in the
Greek nature, namely, cheating and lying.&nbsp; They were so
sharp and clever that the dull Turks were forced to employ them,
so that they grew rich fast; and then, as soon as the Pasha
suspected them of having wealth, however poor they seemed to be,
he would seize them, rob them, or kill them to get their money;
and, what was worse, their daughters were taken away to be slaves
or wives to these Mahommedans.&nbsp; The clergy could get little
teaching, and grew as rude and ignorant as their flocks; for
though the writings of the great teachers of the early Church
were laid up in the libraries in the convents, nobody ever
touched them.&nbsp; But just as, after the Macedonian conquest of
old Greece, the language spread all over the East; so, after the
Turkish conquest of Constantinople, Greek became much better
known in Europe, for many learned men of the schools of
Constantinople took refuge in Italy, bringing their books with
them; the scholars eagerly learned Greek, and the works of Homer
and of the great old Greek tragedians became more and more known,
and were made part of a learned education.&nbsp; The Greeks at
home still spoke the old tongue, though it had become as much
altered from that of Athens and Sparta as Italian is from
Latin.</p>
<p>The most prosperous time of all the Turkish power was under
Solyman the Magnificent, who spread his empire from the borders
of Hungary to those of Persia, and held in truth nearly the same
empire as Alexander the Great.&nbsp; He conquered the island of
Rhodes, on the <!-- page 327--><a name="page327"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 327</span>Christmas day of 1522, from the
Knights of St. John, who were Frankish monks sworn to fight
against the Mahommedans.&nbsp; Cyprus belonged to the Venetians,
and in 1571 a Jew, who had renounced his faith, persuaded Sultan
Selim to have it attacked, that he might gain his favourite
Cyprus wine for the pressing, instead of buying it.&nbsp; The
Venetian stores of gunpowder had been blown up by an accident,
and they could not send help in time to the unfortunate governor,
who was made prisoner, and treated with most savage
cruelty.&nbsp; However, fifty years later, in 1571, the powers of
Europe joined together under Don John of Austria, the brother of
the king of Spain, and beat the Turks in a great sea-fight at
Lepanto, breaking their strength for many years after; but the
king, Philip II. (the husband of our Mary I.), was jealous of his
brother, and called him home, and after that the Venetians were
obliged to make peace, and give up Cyprus.&nbsp; The misfortune
was that the Greeks and Latins hated each other so much that they
never would make common cause heartily against the Turks, and the
Greeks did not like to be under Venetian protection; but Venice
kept Crete, or Candia, as it was now called, till 1670, when the
Turks took it, after a long and terrible siege, lasting more than
two years, during which the bravest and most dashing gentlemen of
France made a wild expedition to help the Christian cause.&nbsp;
But all was in vain; Candia fell, and most of the little isles in
the Archipelago came one by one under the cruel power of the
Turks.</p>

<h2>CHAP. XLIII.&nbsp; THE VENETIAN CONQUEST AND LOSS.&nbsp;
1684&ndash;1796.</h2>
<p>
<img class='dc' alt='A' title='A' src='images/dca.jpg' />gain
there was a time of deliverance for Greece.&nbsp; The Turks had
had a great defeat before Vienna, and in their weak state the
Venetians made another attack on them, and appointed Francis
Morosini commander of the fleet and army.&nbsp; He took the
little Ionian isle of Sta Maura, and two Albanian towns; and many
brave young men, who had read of the glories of ancient Greece in
the course of their studies, came from all parts of Europe to
fight for her.&nbsp; The governor, or Seraskin, was obliged to
retreat, and the Mainots, as the Greeks of the Morea were called,
rose and joined him.&nbsp; Corinth, which was as valuable as ever
as the door of the peninsula, was taken, and nothing in the Morea
remained Turkish but the city of Malvasia.&nbsp; Morosini threw
his men into Lepanto, Patras, and pushed on to Athens; but there
they had six days&rsquo; fighting, during which more harm was
done to the beautiful old buildings and sculptures than had
befallen <!-- page 329--><a name="page329"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 329</span>them in nearly two thousand years of
decay.&nbsp; The Turks had shut themselves up in the Acropolis,
and made a powder magazine of the Parthenon.&nbsp; A shell from
Morosini&rsquo;s batteries fell into it, and blew up the roof,
which had remained perfect all these years, and much more damage
was done; but the city was won at last, and the Venetians were so
much delighted that they chose Morosini Doge, and bestowed on him
the surname of Peloponesiacus in honour of his victory.&nbsp; He
sent home a great many precious spoils, in the way of old
sculptures, to Venice&mdash;in especial two enormous marble lions
which used to guard the gate of the Pir&aelig;us, but which now
stand on either side of the Arsenal at Venice.</p>
<p>Then he laid siege to Negropont, the chief city of the old
isle of Eub&oelig;a; but the plague broke out in his camp, and
weakened his troops so much that they were defeated and forced to
give up the attempt.&nbsp; Illness, too, hindered him from taking
Malvasia; his health was broken, and he died soon after his
return to Venice.&nbsp; Four great and bloody sea-fights took
place during the next few years, and in one the Turks had the
victory, in the others it was doubtful; but when peace was made,
in the year 1699, the Morea was yielded to the Venetians, and
they put a line of forts across the Isthmus to secure it, as in
old times.&nbsp; But the Venetian Republic had lost a great deal
of strength and spirit, and when, in a few years, the Sultan
began to prepare to take back what <!-- page 330--><a
name="page330"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 330</span>he had
lost, the Doge and Senate paid little attention to his doings; so
that, when 100,000 Turks, with the Grand Vizier, sailed against
the Morea, besides a fleet of 100 ships, the Venetian commander
there had only 8000 men and 19 ships.&nbsp; The Venetians were
hopeless, and yielded Corinth after only four days&rsquo; siege;
and though safety had been promised to the inhabitants, they were
cruelly massacred, and the same happened in place after place
till the whole Morea was conquered, and the Venetians took ship
and left the <!-- page 331--><a name="page331"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 331</span>unhappy Greeks to their fate, which
was worse than ever, since they were now treated as rebels.</p>

<p>Several of the Ionian islands on the west side of Greece were
seized by the Turks; but Corfu, the old Corcyra, held out most
bravely, the priests, women, and all fighting most desperately as
the Turks stormed the walls of their city; stones, iron crosses,
everything that came to hand, were hurled down on the heads of
the enemy; but the ramparts had been won, and thirty standards
planted on the walls, when the Saxon general Schulenberg, who was
commanding the Venetians, sallied out with 800 men, and charged
the Turks in their rear, so that those on the walls hurried back
to defend their camp.&nbsp; At night a great storm swept away the
tents, and in the morning a Spanish fleet came to the aid of the
island.&nbsp; The Turks were so much disheartened that they
embarked as quietly as possible in the night; and when the
besieged garrison looked forth in the morning, in surprise at
everything being so still and quiet, they found the whole place
deserted&mdash;stores of powder and food, cannon, wounded men,
and all.&nbsp; Corfu has thus never fallen under Turkish power,
for in the next year, 1717, a peace was made, in which, though
Venice gave up all claim to the Morea, she kept the seven Ionian
islands, and they continued under her power as long as she
remained a free and independent city&mdash;that is to say, till
1796, when she was conquered by the French, and given for a time
to Austria.</p>

<p><!-- page 332--><a name="page332"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
332</span>The state of poor Greece was dreadful.&nbsp; The nobles
lived in fortresses upon the rocks, and the monks in their
fastnesses; but the villages, towns, and coasts were worse off
than ever, for the Turks treated them as rebels, and savagely
oppressed and misused them.&nbsp; Nor were they united among
themselves, for the families who dwelt in the hills were often at
deadly feud with each other; the men shot each other down if they
met; and it ended in whole families of men living entirely within
their castle walls, and never going out except armed to the teeth
on purpose to fight, while all <!-- page 333--><a
name="page333"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 333</span>the
business of life was carried on by the women, whom no one on
either side attempted to hurt.&nbsp; The beautiful buildings in
the cities were going to decay faster than ever, in especial the
Parthenon.&nbsp; When it had lost its roof it was of no further
use as a storehouse, so it was only looked on as a mine of white
marble, and was broken down on all sides.&nbsp; The English Earl
of Elgin obtained leave from the Turkish Government to carry away
those carvings from it which are now in the British Museum, and
only one row of beautiful pillars from the portico of the Temple
has been left standing.</p>
<p>As the Russians had been converted to Christianity by the
clergy of Constantinople, and belonged to the same Church, the
Greeks naturally looked most there for help; but they were not
well treated by the great empire, which seemed to think the chief
use of them was to harass the Turks, and keep them from attacking
Russia.&nbsp; Thus, in 1770, the Russians sent 2000 men to
encourage a rising of the Mainots in the Morea, but not enough to
help them to make a real resistance; and the Greeks, when they
had a little advantage, were always so horridly cruel in their
revenge on their Turkish prisoners as to disgrace the Christian
name, and provoke a return.&nbsp; In 1790, again, the Suliot
Greeks of Albania sent to invite Constantine, the brother of the
Czar of Russia, to be king of Greece, and arranged a rising, but
only misery came of it.&nbsp; The Russians only sent a little
money, encouraged them to rise, and left them to their
fate.&nbsp; The Turkish chief, <!-- page 334--><a
name="page334"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 334</span>Ali Pasha,
who in his little city of Yanina had almost become a king
independent of the Sultan, hunted them down; and the Suliots,
taking refuge among the rocks, fought to the death, and killed
far more than their own number.&nbsp; In one case the Turks
surprised a wedding-party, which retreated to a rock with a
precipice behind.&nbsp; Here the women waited and watched till
all the men had been slain, and then let themselves be driven
over the precipice rather than be taken by the Turks.</p>

their troubles the Greeks never quite lost heart.&nbsp; The
merchants who had thriven in trade sent their sons to be educated
in France, Russia, and Germany, and these learned to think much
of the great old deeds of their forefathers, and they formed a
secret society among themselves, called the <i>Hetaira</i>, which
in time the princes and nobles of the Peloponnesus joined; so
that they felt that if they only were so united and resolute as
to make some Christian power think it worth while to take up
their cause in earnest, they really might shake off the Turkish
yoke.</p>
<p>In 1820, Ali Pasha, the governor of Albania, rebelled, and
shut himself up in the town of Yanina, stirring up the Greeks to
begin fighting on their own account, so as to prevent the Sultan
from using all his power to crush him.&nbsp; So the Greeks began,
under Prince Ipsilanti, who had served in the Russian army, to
march into the provinces on the Danube; but they were not helped
by the Russians, and were defeated by the <!-- page 336--><a
name="page336"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
336</span>Turks.&nbsp; Ipsilanti fled into Austria; but another
leader, called George the Olympian, lived a wild, outlaw life for
some years longer, but as he had no rank the Greeks were too
proud to join him.&nbsp; At last he shut himself up in the old
convent of Secka, and held it out against the Turks for
thirty-six hours, until, finding that he could defend it no
longer, he put a match to the powder, and blew himself and his
men up in it rather than surrender.</p>
<p>But the next year there was another rising all over
Greece.&nbsp; The peasants of Attica drove the Turkish garrison
out of all Athens but the Acropolis; the Suliots rose again, with
secret encouragement from Ali Pasha, and hope seemed coming
back.&nbsp; But when Omar Pasha had been sent from Constantinople
with 4000 Turkish troops, he found it only too easy to rout 700
Greeks at Thermopyl&aelig;, and, advancing into Attica, he drove
back the peasants, and relieved the Turkish garrison in the
Acropolis, which had been besieged for eighty-three days; but no
sooner had he left the place than the brave peasants returned to
the siege.</p>
<p>The worst of the Greeks was that they were very cruel and
treacherous, and had very little notion of truth or honour, for
people who have been long ground down are apt to learn the vices
of slaves; and when the Turks slaughtered the men, burnt the
villages, and carried off the women, they were ready to return
their savage deeds with the like ferocity, and often with more
cunning than the Turks could show; and this <!-- page 337--><a
name="page337"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 337</span>made the
European nations slow of helping them.&nbsp; In this year, 1821,
a Greek captain plotted to set fire to the arsenal at
Constantinople, murder the Sultan in the confusion, and begin a
great revolt of all the Greeks living at Constantinople.&nbsp;
The plot was found out, and terribly visited, for thousands of
Christian families, who had never even heard of it, were slain in
their houses, and the Patriarch of Constantinople, an aged man,
whom everyone loved and respected, was also put to <!-- page
338--><a name="page338"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
338</span>death.&nbsp; Not only were the Christians massacred at
Constantinople, but in most of the other large cities of Turkey,
and only in a few were the people able to escape on board the
Greek merchant ships.&nbsp; These ships carried ten or twelve
guns, were small, swift, and well managed, and little fire-ships
were sometimes sent by them into the Turkish fleet, which did a
great deal of damage.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The slaughter of so many Christians had only enraged instead
of terrifying the others; and a Greek prince named Mavrocordato
brought an army together, which took several cities, but
unhappily was as cruel as the Turks themselves in their treatment
of the conquered.&nbsp; However, they now held Argos, met there,
and made Mavrocordato their President in 1822.&nbsp; Ali Pasha of
Yanina was reduced and shot by the Turks that same year; and Omar
Pasha, who had been sent against him, had a great deal of
desperate fighting with the Suliots and other Albanian Greeks,
but at last he was driven back through the mountains with
terrible loss.</p>
<p>Another horrid deed of the Turks did much to turn men&rsquo;s
minds against them.&nbsp; There were about 120,000 Christians in
the island of Scio, who had taken no part in the war, and only
prayed to be let alone; but two Greek captains chose to make an
attack on the Turkish garrison, and thus provoked the vengeance
of the Turks, who burst in full force on the unhappy island,
killed every creature they found in the capital, and <!-- page
339--><a name="page339"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
339</span>ravaged it everywhere.&nbsp; Forty thousand were
carried off as slaves, and almost all the rest killed; and when
these horrors were over, only 1800 were left in the place.</p>
<p>The cruelty of the Turks and the constancy of the Greeks began
to make all Europe take an interest in the war.&nbsp; People
began to think them a race of heroes like those of old, and
parties of young men, calling themselves Philhellenes, or lovers
of Greece, came to fight in their cause.&nbsp; The chief of these
was the English poet, Lord Byron; but he, as well as most of the
others, found it was much easier to admire the Greeks when at a
distance, for a war like this almost always makes men little
better than treacherous savage robbers in their ways; and they
were all so jealous of one another that there was no obedience to
any kind of government, nor any discipline in their armies.&nbsp;
Byron soon said he was a fool to have come to Greece, and before
he could do anything he died at Missolonghi, in the year
1824.&nbsp; But though the Greeks fought in strange ways of their
own, they at least won respect and interest by their
untamableness, and though Missolonghi was taken, it was only
after a most glorious resistance.&nbsp; When the defenders could
hold out no longer, they resolved to cut their way through the
Turks.&nbsp; One division of them were deceived by a false alarm,
and returned to the town, where, when the enemy entered the
powder magazine, they set fire to it, and blew themselves up,
together with the Turks; the others escaped.</p>
<p><!-- page 340--><a name="page340"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
340</span>Athens was taken again by the Turks, all but the
Acropolis; but the nations of Europe had begun to believe in the
Greeks enough to advance them a large sum of money, which was
called the Greek Loan; and the English admiral, Lord Cochrane,
and an English soldier, General Church, did them much good by
making up the quarrels among their own princes, for actually, in
the midst of this desperate war with the Turks, there were seven
little civil wars going on among different tribes of the Greeks
themselves.&nbsp; General Church collected them all, and fought a
great battle in the plain of Athens with the Turkish commander,
Ibrahim Pasha, but was beaten again; the Acropolis was taken, and
nothing remained to the Greek patriots but the citadel of Corinth
and Naupli&aelig;.</p>
<p>However, France, Russia, and England had now resolved to
interfere on behalf of the Greeks, and when the Sultan refused to
attend to them, a fleet, consisting of ships belonging to the
three nations, was sent into the Mediterranean.&nbsp; They meant
to treat with the Turks, but the Turks and Greeks thought they
meant to fight, and in the bay of Navarino a battle began, which
ended in the utter destruction of the Turkish fleet.&nbsp; Out of
120 ships, only 20 or 30 were left, and 6000 men were
slain.&nbsp; This was on the 20th of October, 1827, and the
terrible loss convinced Ibrahim Pasha that no further attempt to
keep the Morea was of any use, so he sailed away to Egypt, of
which his father was then Viceroy for the Sultan, but which he
and his son <!-- page 341--><a name="page341"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 341</span>have since made into a separate
kingdom.&nbsp; It was in October, 1828, that the Peloponnesus
thus shook off the Turkish yoke.</p>
<p>It was thought best that a French army should be sent to hold
the chief fortresses in the Morea, because the Greeks quarrelled
so among themselves.&nbsp; In the meantime General Church went on
driving the Turks back in the northern parts of Greece, and Count
Capo d&rsquo;Istria was chosen President, but he did not manage
well, and gave the command of Western Greece to his own dull
brother, taking it away from General Church.&nbsp; It seemed as
if the Greeks would not know how to use their freedom now they
had gained it, for the Council and the President were always
quarrelling, and being jealous of each other; and there was
falsehood, robbery, treachery, and assassination
everywhere.&nbsp; And yet everyone hoped that the race that had
stood so bravely all these years would improve now it was
free.</p>

European powers who had taken the little nation of Greeks in
charge, finding that, as a republic with a president, they did
nothing but dispute and fight, insisted that the country should
have a king, who should govern by the help of a parliament.</p>
<p>But the difficulty was that nobody had any claim to be king,
and the Greeks were all so jealous of each other that there was
no chance of their submitting to one of themselves.&nbsp; The
only royal family belonging to their branch of the Church were
the Russians; and France, England, Austria, and all the rest were
afraid of letting the great Russian power get such a hold on the
Mediterranean Sea as would come of Greece being held by one of
the brothers or sons of the Czar.</p>
<p>The first choice was very wise, for it was of one of the
fittest men in Europe, Prince Leopold of Saxe Coburg; and he
accepted their offer at first, but when he had had time to hear
more in letters from Count Capo d&rsquo;Istrias, and found what a
dreadful state the country was in, and how little notion the
people had of truth, honour, or <!-- page 343--><a
name="page343"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 343</span>obedience,
he thought he should be able to do nothing with them, and refused
to come to Greece.&nbsp; In the meantime the Greeks went on worse
than ever.&nbsp; Capo d&rsquo;Istrias was murdered by the son and
brother of a chief whom he had imprisoned; and two bodies of men
met, each calling itself a National Assembly&mdash;one at Argos,
the other at Megara&mdash;and there was a regular civil war,
during which the poor peasants had to hide in the woods and
caves.</p>
<p>At last, in 1832, the second son of the king of Bavaria, Otho,
a lad of seventeen, was chosen king by the conference in London
which was settling the affairs of Greece.&nbsp; He was sent with
a council to rule for him till he should be of age, and with a
guard of Bavarian soldiers, while the French troops were sent
home again; but the Ionian islands remained under the British
protection, and had an English Lord High Commissioner, and
garrisons of English troops.</p>
<p>Otho had been chosen so young that there might be the better
chance of his becoming one with his subjects, but he turned out
very dull and heavy, and caused discontent, because he gave all
the offices he could dispose of to his German friends rather than
to Greeks, which perhaps was the less wonderful that it was very
hard to find a Greek who could be trusted.&nbsp; At last, in
1843, the people rose upon him, forced him to send away all his
Bavarians, and to have Greek ministers to manage the government,
who should be removed at the will of the people.</p>
<p><!-- page 344--><a name="page344"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
344</span>His capital was at Athens, and as everyone wished to
see the places which had been made glorious by the great men of
old Greece, there was such a resort of travellers thither as soon
to make the town flourish; but the Government was so weak, and
the whole people so used to a wild, outlaw life, that the country
still swarms everywhere with robbers, whom the peasants shelter
and befriend in spite of their many horrid crimes.</p>

<p>When the English and French nations, in the year <!-- page
345--><a name="page345"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
345</span>1853, took up the cause of Turkey against Russia, the
Greeks much longed to have fought against their old enemies; but
the two allied nations sent a strong guard to Athens, and kept
them down.&nbsp; Otho had no children, and time did not draw him
and his people nearer together; and after a reign of about thirty
years, it was plain that the experiment had not succeeded.&nbsp;
He resigned, and went home to end his days in Bavaria.</p>
<p>The Greek crown was offered to several more princes, who
refused it, until George, the second son of the king of Denmark,
accepted it in the year 1868.&nbsp; At the same time the Ionian
islands were made over by the English Government to the crown of
Greece, and the British troops withdrawn.&nbsp; One of the first
things that happened in King George&rsquo;s reign was the murder
of three English gentlemen&mdash;Mr. Herbert, Mr. Lloyd, and Mr.
Vyner&mdash;who had gone with a party to see the plain of
Marathon.&nbsp; A gang of robbers came and seized upon them and
carried them off to the hills, demanding a ransom.&nbsp; Lady
Muncaster, who was of the party, was allowed to return to Athens
with her husband, the robbers intending that the ransom should be
collected; but troops were sent out to rescue the prisoners, and
in rage and disappointment the robbers shot them all three.&nbsp;
The robbers were captured and put to death, and the young king
was bitterly grieved at not having been able to prevent these
horrors.</p>

<p>Schools are doing what they can, and the Greeks are very
quick-witted, and learn easily.&nbsp; They are <!-- page 346--><a
name="page346"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 346</span>excellent
sailors, clever merchants, and ready linguists, and they get on
and prosper very fast; but till they learn truth, honesty, and
mercy, and can clear their country of robbers, it does not seem
as if anything could go really well with their kingdom, or as if
it could make itself be respected.&nbsp; Yet we must recollect
that the old Eastern Empire, under which they were for many
centuries, did not teach much uprightness or good faith; and that
since that time they have <!-- page 347--><a
name="page347"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 347</span>had four
hundred years of desperate fighting for their homes and their
creed with a cruel and oppressive enemy, and that they deserve
honour for their constancy even to the death.&nbsp; Let us hope
they will learn all other virtues in time.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
